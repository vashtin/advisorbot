    "description": "s) course uses an interdisciplinary approach and a combination of conventional scientific and indigenous knowledge about environmental change, to enable students to develop a critical understanding of the concepts of environment, climate change, and sustainability and resilience in the face of environmental degradation in Africa. Topics to be covered in the course will include environmental change and extreme climatic conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, floods and winds in Africa; climate change and agriculture, natural resource conservation and conflicts, population growth and climate change, environmental sustainability, and indigenous resilience strategies to combat climate change and its sundry impacts on the continent and its peoples. Various ongoing resilient ecological management strategies, including indigenous knowledge, expertise of locally trained environmentalists, along with regional and global institutional perspectives of climate change, will be identified and discussed using case studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of environmentally, friendly and climate change management policy debates in Africa. The course will be taught through class lectures, seminars, workshops, and scheduled field coursework in specific regions in Africa as a summer study abroad component of the course.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Natural Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 294: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n294\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 297: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n297\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in-depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 299: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n299\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 305: Introduction to Global Health Issues\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n305\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Global Health Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourse will develop awareness of contemporary issues in global health.  BB H 305 Introduction to Global Health Issues (3) This course is an introduction to health and related issues in the global context. It is intended to be an overview of fundamental perspectives about the historical, current, and future public health challenges facing developing and industrialized countries. The course will explore the interrelationships among social structure, culture, demography, health promotion/disease prevention, biology, ecology and health policy of various countries and international health organizations. This course will 1. present key issues related to the history, conceptual frameworks, economic conditions, and policy affecting public health in the global context, 2. examine reports and studies pertaining to major global health issues and comparative research, 3. discuss the role of social structure, culture, gender roles, government policies, and the increasing numbers of the elderly in preventive health behaviors and health promotion in the global context, and 4. critique theories and models used to inform health and development programs in non-Western nations.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBBH\u00a0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nBBH\u00a0305\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 310: Language Rights, Policy, and Planning\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n310\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Rights, Policy, and Planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis is a course on language rights, policy, and planning from individual, group, inter-ethnic, and national perspectives. Linguistic minorities are a consequence of colonization by European powers in different regions of the globe. Other effects of colonization and political conflicts include mass movement, migration, and the emergence of nationalism. In such contexts, minorities have made demands for language rights and used language policy and planning as strategies to realize demands for social justice. This course will examine how linguistic minorities secure opportunities to use their own languages and have them accommodated in official legislation as mother tongue, second, or foreign languages. The course will adopt a global perspective and analyze language rights as well as language policy and planning in diverse regions of the globe, including but not restricted to, Africa, Asia, and South America. Analysis will primarily focus on how language policies can be carried out from different perspectives (e.g., literary, linguistic, and political) in different geographical regions. After examining how language policies operate in and influence society, the course will use sociopolitical ideologies to explore the nature of the relationship between language policies and language rights and the ways this relationship enables one to achieve an expanded understanding of the impact of language policies and language rights on local language practices.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nAPLNG\u00a0310\n, \nGLIS\u00a0310\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 335: African Art\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n335\n\n\n\n\nAfrican Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to the visual arts of Africa, including contemporary African art and the influence of African art outside Africa. \nARTH\u00a0335\n / \nAFR\u00a0335\n African Art (3)(GA;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The course will examine the arts of various African peoples in historical, religious, sociological and geographic contexts, providing an introduction to the many visual art forms of Africa including masquerade, costume, and indigenous architecture. While many of the arts in this field of study are from west and central Africa, the course will also include materials from southern and eastern Africa. Contemporary African art, African Diaspora arts, and the influence of African art on European art are important topics that may be included. In addition to the traditional format of a geographic organization of the material, students will explore thematic approaches. Each of the assignments requires completion of essays which draw upon the multiple course texts and readings. Exams include image identification and short essays.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nARTH\u00a0335\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Arts\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Arts (GA)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 382: Language and Culture in Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n382\n\n\n\n\nLanguage and Culture in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course will provide an introduction to language in Africa from linguistic and cultural perspectives.

Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development. This course complements present offerings in international relations and comparative politics in the PLSC department and can serve as an advanced undergraduate offering in the African Studies concentration in AFR. The course directly complements our present offerings in international conflict given that we don';t have a regularly offered course that focuses on conflict in a specific region. In addition, it will augment our comparative politics offerings with an examination of prominent issues in comparative politics such as political development, democracy, and modernization. The course will fulfill the IL requirement and encourage students understanding of the historical background as well as the political, economic, and cultural factors that influence African politics. African conflicts are often viewed as \"ethnic conflicts\" and in this class students have an opportunity to assess the extent to which ethnic, linguistic, or religious factors influence the likelihood of conflict and contribute to development in African states. Students will also be required to write essays evaluating the contribution of a range of theoretical arguments on Africa';s conflicts in order to assess the degree to which cultural more than political or economic factors contribute to their onset. Students will then have the opportunity to conduct more extensive research on a specific African case to develop their analyses further. These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a \"racial\" difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with \"tribe\". Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. Evaluation in the course will consist largely of examination of the students' brief expository essays and larger case studies for which students will be encouraged to conduct original research. The course should be offered biannually with a class limit of about 40 students.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPL SC014 , PL SC003 , AFR  110\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nPLSC\u00a0434\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 435N: Black Ecologies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n435N\n\n\n\n\nBlack Ecologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAfrican and African Diasporic peoples have been central to the creation and transformation of global ecologies and landscapes. As the birthplace of humankind, the African continent features the longest archaeological record in the world, with abundant, yet often underrepresented, material and historical evidence for remarkable Indigenous African innovations in the areas of technology, food production, and resource and land use. This course specifically examines Black ecologies preceding and then radically transformed by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the enslavement of millions of Africans and their forced translocation to the Americas and Caribbean precipitated ecological transformations on all sides of the Atlantic, as African peoples, knowledge, resources and ecological inheritances were appropriated by the European mercantile system. Enslaved Africans transformed American landscapes via extractive industries of plantations and mines and suffered the emergence of toxic landscapes and disease alongside Native American communities. Africans also recreated African ecologies as they created livelihoods and landscapes of resistance and freedom in the Americas. The legacies of the Atlantic Era maintain a persistent dynamic in which African and African Diasporic communities experience disproportionate burdens of environmental injustice today. The concept of Black ecologies reflects the marginality, systemic racism and dispossession experienced by Black peoples and their landscapes. Black ecologies also allow us to understand African and African Diasporic ecological innovations, resistance and resilience, and the pathways to future sustainability and justice they promise.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 credits of ANTH\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nAFAM\u00a0435N\n, \nANTH\u00a0434N\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education -  Integrative: Interdomain\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 440: Globalization and Its Implications\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n\nGlobalization and Its Implications\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course explores the socioeconomic implications of globalization.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nAFAM\u00a0100N\n or AFR 110 or \nPLSC\u00a03\n or \nPLSC\u00a014\n or \nPLSC\u00a0200N\n or \nPLSC\u00a0220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nIB\u00a0440\n, \nPLSC\u00a0440\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 443: Ethnic Conflict in Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n443\n\n\n\n\nEthnic Conflict in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course explores the various causes and impacts of ethnic conflicts in the African context.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerquisite: \nAFR\u00a0110N\n; \nPLSC\u00a01\n; \nPLSC\u00a03\n; \nPLSC\u00a07N\n; \nPLSC\u00a014\n; \nPLSC\u00a017N\n; PLSC 20\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nPLSC\u00a0443\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 444: Resource Governance in Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n444\n\n\n\n\nResource Governance in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe course is designed to analyze the ecological, economic, political and cultural factors that influence resource extraction and governance in Africa. The course will examine traditional, colonial and post-colonial resource management systems and philosophies, as well as the reengagement and empowerment of local communities in the management of resources. The benefits and trade-offs between conservation, resource extraction, development and justice will be explored. Many students are particularly interested in solutions for biodiversity conservation and climate change; this course will examine theories of behavior change related to environmental management and governance. Students will be introduced to current evidence on how, when and why people take action to address complex environmental issues, including climate change. Finally, the course will explore strategies for evidence-based environmental policy and equitable policy enforcement.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOG\u00a030N\n or \nGEOG\u00a0210\n or \nGEOG\u00a0220\n or \nGEOG\u00a0230\n or \nAFR\u00a0105\n or \nAFR\u00a0110N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nGEOG\u00a0444\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 446: Topics in African Art\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n446\n\n\n\n\nTopics in African Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTopics vary from \"Arts of Eastern and Southern Africa\" to \"Art of West Africa.\"\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n3 credits of ARTH\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nARTH\u00a0446\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Arts\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 447: Topics in the Art of the African Diaspora\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n447\n\n\n\n\nTopics in the Art of the African Diaspora\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSelected topics in arts of the African Diaspora (South America, Caribbean, USA) including masquerades, textiles, architecture and other art forms.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n3 credits of ARTH\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nARTH\u00a0447\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Arts\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 449: Sport in African History\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\nSport in African History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRecent events in sporting history have precipitated changes in perception for many in Africa relative to the historic legacies of racism and colonial rule. These events lead to pivotal questions -What are the broader social and political meanings of sport in African society? And what does the study of sport in Africa tell us about Africa\u00bfs place in world history? This course uses the lens of sport to examine the social and political histories of Africa and the wider diaspora in historical perspective. From the racial and gendered hierarchies of colonialism to the use of sport to protest against social injustices, students are challenged to analyze the interdisciplinary significance of sport far beyond the playing field. One of the main intellectual goals of this course is to use sport to deepen our understanding of specific outcomes in African sport (e.g. South Africa\u00bfs remarkable transformation from pariah of international sport to host of global events like the 2010 World Cup, and Kenyan running successes) from a variety of perspectives. We also consider how Americans travelled to and engaged with African societies as athletes, ambassadors, and activists. Broadly, this course explores sport and social change in Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present. It examines the sporting lives of African athletes, fans, reporters, coaches, and organizers and then connects them to shifting racial identities and power relationships on the continent as well as elsewhere around the world. These histories shed light on the pivotal role of sport in the everyday lives of people across the continent. In the process, we pay attention to primary sources, analyzing the ways in which Africans thought, talked, and represented themes discussed in assigned readings. Ultimately, this course will strengthen student skills of critical thinking, oral communication, collaboration, research, and writing.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0100\n or 3 credits of AFR or 3 credits of HIST\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nKINES\u00a0449\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 454: Government and Politics of Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n454\n\n\n\n\nGovernment and Politics of Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tContemporary African politics, institutions, and ideologies; patterns of change, social forces, and nation building in selected African states. \nPLSC\u00a0454\n / \nAFR\u00a0454\n Government and Politics of Africa (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. In this course, we will discuss the current democratization trend in Africa by focusing on the experiences of African countries.The course is divided into three sections. Part One considers a range of factors that affect politics in Africa. We will discuss in depth the following factors: colonialism, nationalism, the relationship between state and society, ruler-ship, the military, political parties, and economic development. Then, we will consider the experiences of our four cases, to gain a historical background. In part two, we will focus on democratic transitions. We will discuss the factors that enable transitions to occur, as well as the process that transitions follow. Then, we will consider four transitions: two that resulted in the installation of a democratic government (Nigeria in 1979, Sudan in 1986) and two that ended in continued authoritarianism (Angola in 1992, Kenya in 1978). Part three considers the prospects of democracy. We will discuss the probability of a democratic transition occurring in the near future.The goals of this class are four fold. First, students will gain detailed knowledge about four African countries. Second, we will learn how to compare countries. Third, students will have a better understanding of the democratization process in general, and will be able to explain or predict democratization beyond the four cases discussed in this class. Finally, the experiences of these four countries offer a deeper understanding of what democracy is and provide students with greater flexibility to fulfill requirements in either the African and African American Studies major or the Political Science/International Politics major. \nPLSC\u00a0454\n / \nAFR\u00a0454\n will be offered once per year with 35-50 seats per offering.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 credits from: AFR  110 , PL SC003 , PL SC020 , or PL SC022\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nPLSC\u00a0454\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 464: Extractive Industries in Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n464\n\n\n\n\nExtractive Industries in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSocioeconomic and environmental impacts of extractive industries in Africa.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR  110 or at least one of the following: PL SC003 or PL SC014 or PL SC022\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nPLSC\u00a0464\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 479: History of Imperialism and Nationalism in Africa\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n479\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Imperialism and Nationalism in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tA selective overview of the history of iumperialism and nationalism in Africa.  HIST/\nAFR\u00a0479\n History of Imperialism and Nationalism in Africa. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. History/African Studies 479 will provide a selective introduction to major developments and issues concerning Africa's colonial and postcolonial history. The beginning of this course will concentrate on the meanings of imperialism and nationalism and the fact that there is no \"single\" African experience with either of them. This will be followed by a discussion of 19th and 20th century political history in specific contexts in North, East, West, and Southern Afria. The course concludes with a review of African decolonization and the most notable manifestations of recent nationalism on the continent. Special attention will be given to the methods of colonial takeover, methods of African resistance, the West's role in Africa, and Africa's formative role nstruon the West. Religion, the military, and racial/ethnic identity politics will be recurring themes in the course. The actual time devoted to each topic and the sequence of topics will vary from instructor to instructor. The objective of the course is to intrroduce to the causes, nature, and consequences of modern imperialism in Africa. In doing so, students will receive a comprehensive history about a region of the world that is often misunderstood and misrepresented. Also, the course emphasizes critical thinking and analytical writing. The course will consist of polls, pratice discussions, quizzes, response papers, and a final project. As a general education course, this class will provide an introduction to African political history for students of anyn major. Students majoring or minoring in History, African Studies, International Relations, or Political Science will learn vocabulary and information that is basic to the field and broaden their knowledge of History.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 credits in HIST\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nHIST\u00a0479\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: World Cultures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 494: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR 495: Internship\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFR\n\n\n495\n\n\n\n\nInternship\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised off-campus, nongroup instruction including field experiences, practica, or internships.

While addressing major historical movements, the course will also explore the culture of the period - art, literature, music, sports, television, religion, and film. Even though the course covers a relatively short span of years, students will see that American society has undergone dramatic changes in this period as the result of social movements, immigration, wars, political scandal, and technological innovation.

Departing from Concord, the course will explore Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, both of whom read and were inspired by Emerson. Finally, the course will include works by Herman Melville, who formed a friendship with Hawthorne prior to writing Moby-Dick. Though literature constitutes the center piece of this course, iterations of the course may bring in other parts of the cultural, social, and political landscape: slavery, abolitionism, Jacksonian Democracy, western settlement, art, science, and technology.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nENGL\u00a015\n or \nENGL\u00a015A\n or \nENGL\u00a015S\n or \nENGL\u00a015E\n or \nESL\u00a015\n or \nENGL\u00a030H\n or \nENGL\u00a030T\n or \nENGL\u00a0137H\n or \nCAS\u00a0137H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nENGL\u00a0430\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 472: Topics in American Literature\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 99\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n472\n\n\n\n\nTopics in American Literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 99\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFocused study of a particular genre, theme, or problem in American literature.

It serves as a capstone course for American Studies majors who are required to take two sections on different themes, issues, and problems. It is open to other majors seeking exposure to the interdisciplinary methods and concepts of American Studies in addition to interpretative explorations of American society and culture. Examples of themes, issues, and problems that are covered in the course and represent key concepts in American Studies include \"The American Dream,\" \"Nature and Wilderness in American Culture,\" \"The American Way of War,\" and \"American Borders and Frontiers in the American Imagination.\" Methods that are typically covered include rhetorical/symbolic analysis, ethnography of cultural scenes, and comparative analysis of a cultural collection. Concepts include American exceptionalism, colonialism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism in a global context. A variety of evidence is typically used in the course including historical documents, literature, artifacts, oral expressions, photographs and graphics, and popular film and television. The course includes exposure to applications of American Studies knowledge in various institutions and careers such as museums and heritage organizations, government, communications, and education.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseventh-semester standing\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 493: The Folktale in American Literature\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n493\n\n\n\n\nThe Folktale in American Literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tA survey of the literary uses of the folktale and legendary materials, with particular concentration on the literature of America.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENGL 015 or ENGL 030H\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 494: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 494H: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n494H\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 495: Internship\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n495\n\n\n\n\nInternship\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised internship for undergraduate or graduate American Studies majors at a museum or another cultural, historical, or arts agency.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsenior-level status for undergraduate students; 18 credits of   course work in major for graduate students; approval of program   required\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 496: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n496\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 497: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n497\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST 499: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\n\n\n499\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nLionPATH\n\n\nCollegeNET\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nPrivacy and Legal Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n            All Rights Reserved.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF of this page\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Complete Bulletin PDFs\nDownload Undergraduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Graduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Penn State Dickinson Law Bulletin PDF\nDownload College of Medicine Bulletin PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel",

B M B 212 B M B 212 Elementary Biochemistry Laboratory (1)B M B 212 exposes students to techniques typically used in industrial and academic laboratories to isolate proteins, perform enzyme kinetics, characterize carbohydrates and lipids, and study molecular biology. Data interpretation and conceptual understanding are emphasized.Specifically, students determine a weak acid's buffer range with a pH meter; quantify protein concentrations using a spectrophotometer; partially purify acid phosphatase from wheat germ, using ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifugation and dialysis; characterize acid phosphatase kinetics; subject glycogen to acid and salivary amylase hydrolysis, then compare products using thin layer chromatography; isolate plasmid DNA from E.coli, then digest the plasmid DNA with restriction enzymes and analyze the products using agarose gel electrophoresis; make soap from commercial oils and fats; and lastly, identify fatty acids using a gas chromatograph.Students write laboratory reports to present their findings and correlate theory with actual experimental results. Written quizzes assess conceptual understanding of experiments. Teaching assistant evaluations judge the student's level of laboratory skill achievement, preparation, and ability to work with others in a professional manner.A solid chemistry knowledge base (CHEM 012 and either CHEM 034 or 038), previous laboratory experience, and the ability to work with mathematical word problems are expected of all students enrolled in the course. Biochemistry focuses on the chemistry of living organisms. This course provides basic biochemistry laboratory skills and exposure to widely-used methodology to develop a fundamental understanding of biochemistry needed for advanced courses in the student's major and compatible with the student's career interests. Outside resources for the student include reserved books and a course web site: www.bmb.psu.edu/courses/daniel/BMB212/default.htm.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment or concurrent: \nBMB\u00a0211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 221: Applied Biochemistry\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n221\n\n\n\n\nApplied Biochemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tApplication and correlation of biochemical events to physiological-nutritional processes in specialized cells, fluids, and whole animals.  Students may not receive credit for both B M B 221 and 401.  B M B 221 B M B 221 Applied Biochemistry (2)In B M B 221, students will build on their knowledge from Elementary Biochemistry (B M B 211). Emphasis is on the application of biochemical principles to specific problems in medicine, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Students review fundamental principles and learn how biochemical methods, techniques and theory are applied. Class presentations are computer based in some cases. The course may also include class discussions. Evaluation and grading varies with the instructor, but possible methods of evaluation include multiple choice examinations, essay-short answer questions, and in-class contributions.Students will have completed at least three semesters of chemistry before B M B 221, because Elementary Biochemistry (B M B 211) is a prerequisite, and inorganic (CHEM 012) and organic chemistry (CHEM 034 or CHEM 038) are prerequisites for B M B 211. Knowledge of organic chemistry and basic biochemistry is essential so that the course can focus on applications rather than introductory material.B M B 221 is a requirement for those Biotechnology majors who choose not to take the 400-level series of introductory biochemistry courses. It is also required of students enrolled in the science option of the Dairy and Animal Science major. It serves as an elective for all other majors. It is not approved as a general education course.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBMB\u00a0211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 251: Molecular and Cell Biology I\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n251\n\n\n\n\nMolecular and Cell Biology I\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\u00a0251\n Molecular and Cell Biology I (3) is an introduction to the fundamental principles of molecular and cellular biology, with a primary focus on eukaryotic cells.

The objectives of this component of the Honors course are to: 1) introduce students to the scientific method (the formulation of hypotheses based on observation and the processes underpinning the rigorous test of such hypotheses); and 2) provide the intellectual framework for a critical evaluation of the literature. Students are expected to engage in classroom discussion and will be evaluated by a combination of classroom presentations, multiple choice and short essay exams. Students are expected to develop a \"big picture\" view of how the various cellular processes are related to each other and also attain a thorough understanding of the molecular details of the individual processes (e.g. the order and molecular details of events leading from transcription to protein localization within a cell).\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0112\n or \nCHEM\u00a0112H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 252: Molecular and Cell Biology II\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\nMolecular and Cell Biology II\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tContinuation of \nBMB\u00a0251\n / \nMICRB\u00a0251\n ; cytoskeleton, cell growth, division, adhesion, signalling, germ cells, differentiation, immune system, nervous system, plant cells. \nBMB\u00a0252\n / \nMICRB\u00a0252\n Molecular and Cell Biology II (3) focuses on the internal organization on eukaryotic cells and their organization in multi-cellular organisms.

Topics such as the following are included: 1) DNA replication, repair and recombination, 2) RNA transcription and modification, and 3) protein translation, folding and modification. This class is designed as a one-semester course having the objectives of understanding concepts in molecular biology and gene regulation, and exploring research materials and methods used in the laboratory. Course materials are prepared not only from the textbook but also from the primary literature. Therefore, students who want to take this course should have some familiarity with reading research articles. \nBMB\u00a0400\n is for advanced undergraduates who have already taken introductory molecular biology and biochemistry. Knowledge of molecular biology is essential background for pursuit of a career in the life sciences, including academia, medicine, industry, forensic science and science policy.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nBMB\u00a0251\n or \nMICRB\u00a0251\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBMB\u00a0251H\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n) and (\nCHEM\u00a0212\n or \nCHEM\u00a0212H\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 401: General Biochemistry\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n401\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Biochemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinciples of the structure and function of biological molecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, membranes, proteins, and enzymes. \nBMB\u00a0401\n is the first course of the general biochemistry series, a sequence designed to prepare students for careers and graduate study in the life sciences. Overall, biochemistry describes, in chemical and molecular terms, the structures, mechanisms, and chemical processes at work in all living things, and abstracts organizing principles that underlie life in all its diverse forms. Building upon concepts introduced in molecular and cellular biology and in organic chemistry, students in \nBMB\u00a0401\n synthesize and apply this knowledge toward understanding the structure and function of the major classes of cellular constituents: water, and the various macromolecules -- amino acids and proteins, sugars, and polysaccharides, nucleotides and nucleic acids, fatty acids and lipids, and membranes and various membrane proteins. These molecules interact to comprise the next level of multi-and mixed molecular structures and organelles that enable a cell to carry out its many metabolic functions. Students also learn about the technologies used to study cellular components and processes, and current advances in biotechnology that have accelerated the pace of discovery in the field. Having gained familiarity with the molecules found in a cell, students are well-equipped to take on more advanced topics in the exciting, rapidly-evolving fields of the life sciences. An overriding theme in biochemistry is that polymers of living systems, though structurally large and functionally complex, are highly ordered chemical entities, with specific sequences of monomeric subunits giving rise to discrete structures and functions. The course includes all of the following topics: 1) an introduction to protein structure function relationships, covering the structural basis of protein functions; 2) enzyme kinetics and mechanisms; 3) simple and complex carbohydrates and topics in glycobiology that include energy storage, framework skeleton, and specific molecular recognition; 4) various classes of lipids, including phospholipids, complex lipids, membrane biology and transport systems, and 5) an analysis of the biochemical basis of signal transduction describing how specific signals regulate biomolecular activity both within a cell and between cells to keep an organism in homeostasis. Lastly, as a transition to intermediary metabolism in \nBMB\u00a0402\n, an introduction to bioenergetic principles is included to provide a framework for understanding pathways of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, using glycolytic reactions as an example.

The central experiment entails all basic procedures necessary to clone a gene, i.e. to make a recombinant molecule comprised of DNA from two sources. Students use restriction enzymes to cut two distinct DNA molecules into smaller fragments. The fragments are mixed and treated with the enzyme Ligase, which randomly combines small fragments into large recombinant DNA molecules in new combinations different in composition from either original molecule. The recombinant molecules, which include genes that confer drug resistance, are transformed intoE. coli cells that initially have no drug resistance. Cells that acquire recombinant DNA molecules are identified by selective plating on growth media containing drugs. From the transformed cells, recombinant DNA is isolated and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, completing the array of basic gene cloning techniques. In addition to this central, multi-session experiment, students also do PCR and an investigation of the lac operon, a classic molecular genetic model system. The proteins portion of \nBMB\u00a0442\n / MICRB 442 is designed to introduce students to protein biochemistry topics and laboratory techniques typically encountered in academic and commercial settings. Students will learn about buffers, spectroscopy, enzyme purification and characterization methods. Specifically, the experiments include preparation of buffers and performing kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax values. Separation of a mixture of phycobiliproteins using ion-exchange column chromatography is a major experiment that the students will perform to learn protein purification methods. In this experiment they will learn how to pour a column, apply sample, elute it with salt gradient and collect fractions using automated fraction collector. Ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis will be part of protein purification procedures. Characterization of the separated proteins will be performed by determining the absorption spectra with spectrophotometer and by determining the molecular weights of the subunits of the phycobiliproteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nCHEM\u00a0202\n or CHEM 202H or \nCHEM\u00a0210\n or \nCHEM\u00a0210H\n) and (\nBMB\u00a0251\n or \nMICRB\u00a0251\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBMB\u00a0251H\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n) or (\nMICRB\u00a0201\n or \nMICRB\u00a0201H\n) Concurrent Courses: \nBMB\u00a0211\n or \nBMB\u00a0401\n or \nBMB\u00a0401H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 443W: Laboratory in Protein Purification and Enzymology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n443W\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory in Protein Purification and Enzymology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course is intended to provide advanced Biochemistry & Molecular Biology students with in class instruction on various laboratory methods used to explore the physical & chemical properties of proteins and other topics relevant to enzymes such as protein purification techniques and enzyme kinetic assays.

In addition to exploring historical and current cell biology research articles, students will develop two vital scientific skills; critical thinking as applied to experimental data and creative thinking about solving unresolved questions in cell biology. In this course students will read from journals to explore questions about cell biology and how cell biologists decipher cell functions. Instead of a general survey of cell biology, we delve into specific issues, often looking at \"classic\" papers describing how a specific phenomenon was first investigated to place current questions in context before progressing to the latest publications exploring how innovative techniques have been applied to deciphering cell function. The course is divided into units, each of which emphasizes content in a different area. Actual content may vary from year to year as the course is updated to reflect progress in a field of research. We have previously explored the general areas of cell membrane dynamics, intracellular protein trafficking, cell cycle regulation, cell signaling pathways and cancer cell biology. Finally, the course ends with a unit on stem cells and therapeutic cloning technology. A portion of the final unit is also devoted to discussing the ethical implications of stem cell research with an emphasis on how to make personal decisions about how our society should approach these issues. Reading guides are provided for each assignment to help students find and understand important points in reading assignments. Class periods are devoted to explanations and instructor-led discussions about the readings with an emphasis on understanding the questions, the methods used to approach the questions, the experimental results and the interpretations of the results. Furthermore, periodic class periods are dedicated to experimental approach exercises where students work in groups to practice posing new questions as suggested by our readings and proposing experiments to answer these questions. These skills are vital part of what cell biologists do daily, and these exercises provide practice in thinking like a scientist. Students have previously reported that by taking this course they acquired the ability to read and understand the primary literature and have gained an in-depth understanding about how to use various experimental techniques.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBMB\u00a0252\n or \nMICRB\u00a0252\n or \nBMB\u00a0252H\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nMICRB\u00a0460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 464: Molecular Medicine\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n464\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Medicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAn exploration of the impact of advances in molecular biology on understanding disease mechanisms, medical diagnosis, and therapeutics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBMB\u00a0251\n or \nMICRB\u00a0251\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBMB\u00a0251H\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 465: Protein Structure and Function\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n465\n\n\n\n\nProtein Structure and Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tA study of the relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function.

These technologies not only enable affordable sequencing of individual genomes (human or any other species); they also allow us to investigate numerous ways in which the genome performs its biological functions in different cell types and how mutations in genomes give rise to various phenotypes. However, given the volume of data and the noisy nature of biological measurements and signals, we require intelligent and efficient computational algorithms to make sense of genomic datasets. The discipline of bioinformatics and computational biology aims to meet this need. This course focuses on understanding and applying the computational methods and algorithms that are used to analyze genomic data, in particular the large datasets arising from high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. During the course, we will focus on several application areas in genomics that require computational analyses. These topics will be organized around three main themes: - Genomes: comparing DNA and protein sequences; locating sequences on the genome; assembling genomes. - Evolution: reconstructing evolutionary relationships; personal genomics; detecting disease-associated genome variations. - Function: understanding biochemical activities using functional genomics; discovering functional elements in genome sequences; characterizing regulatory relationships between genes. For each of the genomics topics listed above, we will focus on understanding the computational algorithms that are used to analyze data. Such algorithms may include dynamic programming (sequence alignment), graph algorithms (assembly), clustering methods (phylogenetics & metagenomics), and machine-learning approaches such as Expectation Maximization, Gibbs sampling, and Hidden Markov Models (various applications in discovering functional genomic elements). Students will also develop practical bioinformatics analysis skills throughout the course. Each bioinformatics topic will be accompanied by practical exercises. Students will also work in teams to research and develop a project that applies computational methods to a genomics-related problem.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBMB\u00a0251\n or \nBMB\u00a0251H\n or \nMICRB\u00a0251\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n or \nCMPSC\u00a0465\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 484: Functional Genomics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n484\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Genomics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBiochemical, genetic and evolutionary approaches to comprehensive discovery of functional DNA segments in genomes, including genes and regulatory sequences. \nBMB\u00a0484\n Functional Genomics (3) What in your genomic DNA makes you different from chimpanzees, mice or flies? What sequences in your DNA make it more or less likely that you will develop diabetes or cancer? These are questions of widespread interest, answers to which could play major roles in personalized medicine and in understanding our place in the biosphere. Modern genomic analysis uses powerful technologies and generates massive amounts of data, which are yielding exciting insights into answering these questions. One hallmark of genomic research is that data are released rapidly along with tools for browsing and analyzing it. Thus not only can you learn the major results by reading papers, but you can examine the underlying data and do your own analyses. Discovery is no longer the exclusive domain of the data producers - you can join in!This course will introduce students to ongoing research aimed at identifying functional regions in genomes and encourage them to use web-based bioinformatics tools for exploring the genomic and epigenetic data. Students will develop creative projects that address issues in functional genomics of high interest to them.The course has two phases, the first on the basics of genomics (sequencing, alignment, assembly, resources), and the second on the search for functional elements in genomes. The course will explore ways to find:- Protein-coding genes within genomes- Transcribed regions: How much of the genome is transcribed? Which transcribed regions do not code for proteins? What roles do they play in the cell (regulatory and enzymatic)?- Evolutionary signatures of function: How can you use genome comparisons between species to estimate the amount of functional sequence - and to identify it?- Non-genic functional sequences: How do you map epigenetic features associated with gene regulation, such as histone modifications, DNase hypersensitive sites, and transcription factor occupancy?- Function by phenotype: Given the ability of genetic association to find loci that contribute to complex traits, such as disease susceptibility, how does functional genomics aid in finding basis of these traits?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nBMB\u00a0251\n or \nMICRB\u00a0251\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230W\n or \nBMB\u00a0251H\n or \nBIOL\u00a0230M\n) and (\nBIOL\u00a0222\n or \nBIOL\u00a0322\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 485: Human Genomics and Biomedical Informatics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n485\n\n\n\n\nHuman Genomics and Biomedical Informatics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to the field of Human Genomics and Biomedical Informatics, in particular in the context of genetic architecture of complex human diseases and traits.

Through \nBMB\u00a0490\n/491, students will complete a fast-tracked start-to-finish research project and in doing so will learn to perform, explain, apply, and interpret good science. In \nBMB\u00a0491\n, students focus on effectively communicating scientific findings and preparing their data for publication. Students will use a variety of media to communicate science across different audiences. They will prepare written, oral, and visual presentations while learning to adapt content and style for different contexts. Students will complete major projects in stages, guided by weekly exercises and lectures on content, structure, and formatting for different types of scientific writing. Students will also learn how to assemble figures and visual aids to communicate their approaches and findings. Readings and figures from the scientific literature will provide opportunities to evaluate methods of visual and written communication, while continuing to promote a deeper understanding of cell structure and function. Building expertise across BMB490/491 in an area of cell and molecular biology allows students to critically evaluate the content and style of published articles, and to build conclusions about their own research results. Students will also engage in extensive peer review and will be expected to incorporate feedback into improving their writing and presentation skills. Throughout this course, students will gain an appreciation for the importance of effective communication in science, and will build the skills necessary to logically, accurately, ethically, and persuasively communicate. These skills will be extremely valuable in research-related careers, but also apply to any position where students act as consumers, producers, advocates, or interpreters of science.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBMB\u00a0490\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 494: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 496: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n496\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 497: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n497\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB 499: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMB\n\n\n499\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nLionPATH\n\n\nCollegeNET\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nPrivacy and Legal Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n            All Rights Reserved.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF of this page\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Complete Bulletin PDFs\nDownload Undergraduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Graduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Penn State Dickinson Law Bulletin PDF\nDownload College of Medicine Bulletin PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel",

Students will develop skills and techniques for managing and executing engineering design projects in the following fields: agricultural engineering, food and biological processing engineering, and/or natural resource engineering. Projects are sponsored by faculty, industry, or community initiatives and are structured to span two semesters. In the Fall semester, the emphasis is on classroom lectures, preliminary analyses, and project proposal development. In the Spring semester, the emphasis is on hands-on laboratory activities, project execution, and report preparation. Project teams perform all facets of the design process. This includes problem identification, planning of the project, formulation of design specifications, development and evaluation of alternative conceptual designs, development of detailed designs, consideration of safety and design optimization, design implementation, design testing, and analysis and documentation of results. Students improve their writing skills through preparation and refinement of various documents including a design notebook, proposal, statement of work, design specification report, status reports, and a final report. Students also present their results in other formats, including poster and oral presentations for both technical and non-technical audiences.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment:  \n(\nBE\u00a0391\n or BRS 391 or \nENGL\u00a0202C\n) and (11 or more credits of BE) and (Seventh Semester standing or higher)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 461: Design of Fluid Power Systems\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n461\n\n\n\n\nDesign of Fluid Power Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course is designed to provide a solid foundation for understanding hydraulic and pneumatic systems for power transmission and motion control, including hydrostatic transmissions and electro-hydraulic systems.

Them, students are introduced to the unique physical and structural characteristics of solid lumber and other wood products, such as plywood and other panel products and structural composite lumber, including laminated veneer lumber, parallel strand lumber and composite wood I-joists. The engineering principles and specifications for designing wood structural members, including tension members, beams, columns, and beam-columns are presented in detail using the National Design Specification for Wood Design. Design specifications for designing wood structural connections using dowels, such as nails, bolts and lag-screws, are presented. Design procedures for designing selected wood-frame systems, such as floors, trusses, structural diaphragms and shear walls, are also presented. Students are introduced to a computer program which is an invaluable aid for analyzing and designing wood framed structural systems. At the conclusion of the course students will be able to specify structural loads for wood framing systems and analyze and design wood beams, columns, beam-columns, typical wood diaphragms and shear walls, simple wood structural systems, and a range of wood structural connections. The course builds on engineering students' prior knowledge from strength of materials and elementary structural analysis.

Students will develop skills and techniques for managing and executing engineering design projects in the following fields: agricultural engineering, food and biological processing engineering, and/or natural resource engineering. Projects are sponsored by faculty, industry, or community initiatives and are structured to span two semesters. In the Fall semester, the emphasis is on classroom lectures, preliminary analyses, and project proposal development. In the Spring semester, the emphasis is on hands-on laboratory activities, project execution, and report preparation. Project teams perform all facets of the design process. This includes problem identification, planning of the project, formulation of design specifications, development and evaluation of alternative conceptual designs, development of detailed designs, consideration of safety and design optimization, design implementation, design testing, and analysis and documentation of results. Students improve their writing skills through preparation and refinement of various documents including a design notebook, proposal, statement of work, design specification report, status reports, and a final report. Students also present their results in other formats, including poster and oral presentations for both technical and non-technical audiences.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBE\u00a0460W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 467: Design of Stormwater and Erosion Control Facilities\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n467\n\n\n\n\nDesign of Stormwater and Erosion Control Facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course equips students with the ability to design sediment and stormwater impoundments and erosion control structures used in agriculture and the development of the agricultural-urban interface. Predictive hydrology is presented along with an introduction to a hydrology-based model used in the land-development industry. Basins are presented as fundamental structures used to attenuate stormwater peaks as well as holding ponds to facilitate gravitational sediment removal from stormwater runoff. Various sediment traps are also included. Flood routing is developed so students understand and can design for flood peak attenuation. Low Impact Development (LID) practices such as green roofs, bioretention areas and vegetated filter strips are presented as infiltration-based alternatives to traditional stormwater management. Open channel design procedures including maximum permissible velocity and tractive force are reviewed. The course includes two design projects. Students are assigned a land parcel and the proposed development. Students are expected to develop an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan and a Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan. Both projects are expected to be developed in compliance with state regulatory standards and to include LID practices as appropriate. In addition to the design projects, students may be evaluated on lab reports, in-class activities, and a mid-term exam.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBE\u00a0307\n or \nCE\u00a0461\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 468: Microbiological Engineering\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n468\n\n\n\n\nMicrobiological Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMicrobiological engineering is the application of basic engineering principles and designs in biochemical and biological processes.

These principles then serve as the basis for design of systems for application of livestock manures, biosolids, septage, wastewater effluents, and other residual materials. Relevant state and federal regulations will be covered to illustrate the impact of regulations and policies on engineering practice. The course culminates in a project for which students design a system to dispose of municipal, agricultural, or industrial byproduct or wastewater. Principles will be reinforced with several homework sets. Field trips will expose students to land-based waste disposal processes and systems. The course will serve as a senior-level engineering science/design course in Biological Engineering (BE).\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBE\u00a0307\n or \nCE\u00a0370\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 487: Simulation Modeling for Water Resources Management\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n487\n\n\n\n\nSimulation Modeling for Water Resources Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course will provide hands-on experience of several commonly available simulation models for natural resources engineers for investigating water resources related issues. The models will serve as a base from which students can investigate the effects of different management design scenarios on watershed system responses. The course introduces general modeling concepts of data processing, model development, model calibration/validation and uncertainty analysis. Model development concepts will be introduced with data driven regression models for rainfall-runoff simulation. Then, students will work with a range of simulation models commonly used by industry or government agencies. One model might be used as an initial exploration of modeling for an entire watershed and to show the hydrologic responses for various subwatersheds (agriculturally dominated vs. urban dominated). A second model might be used to explore more in-depth modeling for an urban watershed. A third model might be used to introduce modeling concepts of demand driven closed conduit water systems in drinking water distribution systems. Students will select one of the three models to study in detail for a project where they evaluate a water management structure design or investigate a water resources related issue.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nBE\u00a0307\n or \nCE\u00a0461\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 494: Senior Thesis\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nSenior Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStudents must have approval of a thesis adviser before scheduling this course.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 494H: Honors Thesis\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n494H\n\n\n\n\nHonors Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIndependent study directed by a faculty supervisor that culminates in the production of a Biological Engineering honors thesis\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite At Enrollment: \n5th semester standing or higher in Schreyer Honors College and permission of BE honors advisor\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 495: Agricultural Engineering Internship\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n495\n\n\n\n\nAgricultural Engineering Internship\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIndependent study and supervised cooperative education experience related to the student's career objective.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 496: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n496\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 497: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n497\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE 499: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBE\n\n\n499\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nLionPATH\n\n\nCollegeNET\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nPrivacy and Legal Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n            All Rights Reserved.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF of this page\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Complete Bulletin PDFs\nDownload Undergraduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Graduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Penn State Dickinson Law Bulletin PDF\nDownload College of Medicine Bulletin PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel",

Chemistry impacts virtually every area of our lives, from how our bodies work, to the environment, to new materials, to how we live and work. The goals of this course are to teach students to recognize that what happens at the molecular level directly shapes the macroscopic world. Students will gain an understanding of (1) how atoms combine to form molecules; (2) how molecules interact and react with each other; and (3) how molecular-level structure and interactions affects a material's macroscopic properties. Students will also learn the problem-solving skills necessary to apply and interpret simple mathematical models and graphical representations of chemical and physical phenomena. The honors version of \nCHEM\u00a0110\n covers the same topics as the regular offering but at a level appropriate for students with advanced backgrounds and talents.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCompletion of or placement beyond \nMATH\u00a022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Natural Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 111: Experimental Chemistry I\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Chemistry I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\u00a0111\n is a one-credit introductory general chemistry laboratory course.

One year of high school chemistry is strongly recommended, and students should have math placement beyond the level of \nMATH\u00a021\n or \nMATH\u00a032\n. 3 Credits, fulfills the General Education requirements. Course topics include dimensional analysis, atomic structure and periodicity, chemical bonding, molecular structure, states of matter and intermolecular forces, basic gas laws, solutions and solubility, acids, bases and equilibria, reaction stoichiometry and thermodynamics. In addition, fundamentals of organic nomenclature, properties of main organic functional groups, structure and function of biological macromolecules, as well as metabolism will be discussed. The course will emphasize chemistry in environmental and health-related contexts. This course is primarily designed for students in a program that does not require the more theoretical and mathematically oriented general chemistry courses (\nCHEM\u00a0110\n/112), such as some majors in the colleges of Nursing, Agriculture Sciences, and Health & Human Development. It is a suitable prerequisite for the organic chemistry course sequence \nCHEM\u00a0202\n/203. This course is not appropriate for medical school preparation and will not serve as a prerequisite for the organic chemistry \nCHEM\u00a0210\n/212 course sequence. Students majoring in chemistry, other natural sciences, or engineering will normally register in the \nCHEM\u00a0110\n/112 sequence.

Certain chemical reactions learned in \nCHEM\u00a0202\n will be reviewed along with the mechanistic details of some of these processes. Special topics such as drug discovery, natural product isolation, and synthesis will be surveyed. The laboratory teaches students the fundamental techniques used by organic chemists such as recrystallization, melting point determination, distillation, extraction, thin-layer chromatography, and column chromatography. Mastery of these basic techniques lays the foundation for carrying out organic syntheses and/or natural product isolations. Students are given hands-on access to instrumentation for the characterization of synthetic products or organic unknowns using standard analysis methods such as IR, NMR, UV/V is spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, polarimetry, HPLC, GC and GC-MS.

The fundamentals of organic chemistry, as developed in \nCHEM\u00a0210\n, the first part of a two-semester organic chemistry sequence, are required for scientists to understand the electronic structure and reactivity of simple and complex molecules. Concepts taught in \nCHEM\u00a0210\n include hierarchical bonding models (Lewis dot, valence bond, molecular orbital), Lewis acids and bases, conformational analysis and stereochemistry, functional groups and their reactivity (alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, dienes, aromatics, alcohols, and ethers), organic reaction mechanisms focusing on electrophiles and nucleophiles, and aromaticity.

It should be followed by Chemistry 212H. The concentrated and fast-moving pace of this course is facilitated by four class periods/week, seven (biweekly) hour exams and an evening recitation dedicated to the informal discussion of the subject material covered in previous or pending hour exams. This course will emphasize the mechanistic underpinning of organic chemistry. That is, students will not only learn what happens in organic chemistry but also, and more importantly, why and how. It is hoped that students will develop an intuition for the structure, function and reactivity properties of organic compounds which is of fundamental importance for subsequent studies in the life, material and chemical sciences. The course begins with an introduction to the structural aspects of organic compounds and an appreciation of the three-dimensionality of the subject based upon the important concepts of molecular orbital theory, valence bond theory, hybridization and conformational analysis. Reaction mechanisms and organic synthesis, two important topics that are emphasized throughout the course, are introduced early in the context of addition reactions of alkenes and alkynes. Perhaps the most abstract/vexing topic in organic chemistry is next encountered, namely, stereochemistry. These fundamentals are then used to explore the reactivity properties of various classes of compounds including substitutions and eliminations of alkyl halides, free radical reactions of alkenes, isomerization and cycloadditions of conjugated pi systems, and electrophilic substitution reactions of aromatic compounds.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0112\n or \nCHEM\u00a0112H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 212: Organic Chemistry II\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n212\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Chemistry II\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tContinuation of \nCHEM\u00a0210\n.

The course will begin with conceptually new material that will be applied in the laboratory course, namely, the elucidation of the structures of organic compounds using mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The majority of the new material is concerned with the chemistry of carbonyl compounds and includes: 1) the nucleophilic addition reactions of ketones and aldehydes; 2) nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions of acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters and amides; 3) carbonyl alpha-substitution reactions and 4) carbonyl condensation reactions. The latter part of the course will be concerned with biologically relevant compounds such as amines, amino acids/peptides/proteins and carbohydrates.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0210\n or \nCHEM\u00a0210H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 212H: Organic Chemistry II - Honors\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n212H\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Chemistry II - Honors\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tContinuation of \nCHEM\u00a0210\n(H).

This honors course focuses more on depth than breadth, and will delve into some of the more modern approaches/theories to key topics. Most of the material derives from the chemistry of carbonyl compounds. The classic topics -- carbonyls as as electrophiles and as nucleophile (enolate) precursors -- will be covered. In addition, discussions of stereochemical selectivity issues will provide the framework to introduce contemporary concepts of stereoelectronic and steric effects into these topics. For example, Cram, Felkin-Ahn and chelation-based models for stereoselective addition of nucleophiles to aldehydes/ketones will be developed, as will chiral auxiliary chemistry for stereoselective enolate addition reactions. In addition to carbonyl chemistry, an introduction to spectroscopic techniques for compound characterization will be included. These techniques include mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, a survey of pericyclic reactions, along with the molecular orbital (stereoelectronic) underpinnings of chemical selectivity observed in these processes, will be pursued. Class grades will be based on 5 exams, 5 (out of 6) homework assignments, and a final exam.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0210\n or \nCHEM\u00a0210H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 213: Laboratory in Organic Chemistry\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 Credits/Maximum of 2\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory in Organic Chemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2 Credits/Maximum of 2\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBasic laboratory operations; synthesis and chemical or instrumental analysis.

Both instructors will be present in the classroom throughout the semester, providing joint presentations and leading discussions. The integration of humanities and natural sciences domain content will encourage students from humanities and natural science backgrounds, as well as other interested students, to take the course and learn how to integrate these two domains of knowledge in their education and their lives after leaving Penn State. This course teaches both basic concepts of chemistry and their cultural elaboration in literature, and it models a critical assessment of the implications of chemistry and literature emerging from a shared cultural field, rather than autonomously from two separate cultures. The course seeks to provide students with a nuanced understanding of how literature and science inform each other and negotiate cultural, religious, and political tensions. Understanding the origin and development of these ideas, perspectives, and discoveries is an essential component of science and scientific achievement, but too often our methods of teaching science focus almost exclusively on   teaching facts and theories at the expense of the historical discovery, creation, and development of those facts and theories. This courses teaches both the scientific facts and theories and the contexts of their production in order to sharpen students' abilities at critical evaluation of facts. The literary and scientific focus will vary from class to class, but may include writings by literary authors such as Mary Shelley, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, Garrett Serviss, Aldous Huxley, Roald Hoffmann, Carl Djerassi, Don DeLillo, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, D.H. Lawrence, A. E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, Arthur Conan Doyle, Camille Flammarion, and Rachel Carson, and scientific texts by scientists such as T.H.

Key concepts of environmental chemistry. The specific focus of this class will vary from class to class, but all sections will spend approximately 40% of the class on units specifically devoted to key concepts in basic chemistry, 40% of the class on literary interpretations of and influences upon concepts in chemistry in specific historical periods, and 20% of the class on significant methods of theorizing the boundaries between and interrelationships of science and culture., and on the concept of the \"culture of science.\" However, these subjects will be interwoven throughout the semester. Indeed, the pedagogy of the course depends upon the literature and the science not being neatly separated from each other. Instead, students will learn up-to-date science while exploring the origins, development, and cultural dimensions of that science, and will learn to integrate their understanding of the domains of science and the humanities through the course. The course will be offered once every year with approximately 20-35 seats per offering.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nENGL\u00a0233N\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education -  Integrative: Interdomain\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 294: Special Problems and Research\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-4 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n294\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Problems and Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-4 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDesigned for freshman or sophomore students who are prepared to undertake special problems and research by arrangement with a faculty member.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 294H: Special Problems and Research - Honors\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-4 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n294H\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Problems and Research - Honors\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-4 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDesigned for freshman or sophomore students who are prepared to undertake special problems and research by arrangement with a faculty member.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPermission of instructor\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 296: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n296\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, that are supervised on an individual basis and that fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 297: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n297\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 301: Environmental Chemistry and Analysis\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n301\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Chemistry and Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tChemical principles, interpretation, and methods of analysis for groundwater, water supply, wastewater treatment, stream pollution.  \nCHEM\u00a0301\n \nCHEM\u00a0301\n Environmental Chemistry and Analysis (3) The objective of the course is to introduce students to water quality chemistry and the associated laboratory analytical techniques commonly used in groundwater, water supply, wastewater treatment, stream pollution control.

The exposition of both experimental phenomena and theory complements the content of other upper-level courses in physical chemistry such as \nCHEM\u00a0450\n and \n452\n.Specifically, the types of radioactive decay are described, and, using this information, the equations that relate the growth and decay, i. e., the kinetics, of radioactive nuclei are derived. In parallel, a variety of types of nuclear reactions, such as neutron capture are introduced and used to develop the equations that governing the kinetics of nuclear reactions, including the concept of cross section. To describe the nature of nuclear matter, the relationships between energy, binding energy, and mass, are developed and augmented with the introduction of related quantities including the nuclear magnetic-dipole moment, total angular momentum of the nucleus, and Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. A basic introduction to quantum mechanics, including several problems of increasing complexity, namely, the one-dimensional particle-in-a-box, the three-dimensional particle-in-a-cubic-box, and the particle-in-a-spherical box is then provided. The latter problem forms the basis for developing the single-particle shell-model of the nucleus, which is compared to the single-particle shell-model of the atom, namely, the hydrogen-atom problem. The barrier-penetration theory of alpha-decay, Fermi's phase-space theory of beta-decay, and the selection rules for gamma-ray decay are then presented. Final topics include the interactions of radiation with matter and the biological effects of radiation.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0452\n or \nPHYS\u00a0237\n or \nNUCE\u00a0301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nNUCE\u00a0405\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 408: Computational Chemistry\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\nComputational Chemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to numerical and nonnumerical computer uses in physical science.  \nCHEM\u00a0408\n \nCHEM\u00a0408\n Computational Chemistry (3) \nCHEM\u00a0408\n introduces some of the many ways in which computers are used in modern chemical research.

Techniques of crystal growth and selection are summarized. X-ray sources and instrumentation are described briefly. Unit cells, Miller planes, unit cell geometry and Bragg's law give rationale to the diffraction experiment. Space group symmetry is connected with data collection and the contents of the unit cell. Practical considerations of data collection and instrumentation are covered next. The theoretical description of structure factors and Fourier synthesis leads to consideration of solutions to the phase problem. The remainder of the course illustrates the process of structure solution using real data and software readily available to the students. All the details of publication of a crystal structure; the CIF, ORTEP figures and the format of the experimental section of most journals is described using actual student selected publications.

This focus enables the student to consider macroscopic properties based on the constituent molecular properties. After a very brief introduction to classical thermodynamics, the statistics of large systems is introduced, used to develop the Boltzmann distribution of energies and then combined with the quantum mechanical structure of energy levels to form a basis to predict and understand atomic and molecular properties such as heat capacity and chemical reaction equilibrium. Solution thermodynamics, interfacial phenomena and colligative properties are discussed in terms of lattice models. The course then turns to a molecular view of transport and chemical reaction rates. Molecular transport is described in terms of random molecular motion and intermolecular forces that tie together to give macroscopic behavior such as ionic conductivity and mass diffusion. Reaction rates are formulated in terms of the distributions of energies and statistical probabilities of the combined reactants in a transition state. Cooperativity in phase transitions is discussed, followed by adsorption and catalysis. Examples with proteins and other biomolecules, as well as polymers and various solutions, appear throughout the course.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM  450 or \nCHE\u00a0220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 468: Molecular Spectroscopy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n468\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Spectroscopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIt is said that there are more than nine million organic chemical compounds. If you add to this list, inorganic complexes, composite materials such as alloys, minerals, and intermediate species like radicals and transition states, the list becomes truly monstrous. Also, the number of properties that interest scientists and engineers is vast (although modest compared to the above). A fascinating aspect of science is that it reveals a small number of general principles that govern the huge number of substances and their reactivities and properties. One powerful tool in the chemist's toolbox is Spectroscopy, which allows us to identify and monitor molecules at stages prior, during, and post reaction. Spectroscopy has allowed chemists to generalize many aspects of molecular behavior in a wide assortment of environments, ranging from vacuum to physiological conditions. In this course,  condensed-phase spectroscopy will be emphasized, and we will focus largely on how the tools of molecular spectroscopy can be used to describe interactions between molecules and their surroundings. These interactions can have broad chemical consequences, which include changing molecular polarizabilities and reaction energetics. Therefore, the outcomes of condensed-phase chemical processes are largely influenced by these molecule-surroundings interactions. In this context, we will address important questions of how solvents modify molecular spectroscopic signals, and how these changes can be used for understanding chemical processes. We will begin by describing the properties of electromagnetic radiation and the absorption and emission of light by molecules. In particular, we will introduce, discuss, and apply the concepts of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and superpositions of molecular electronic and vibrational states. We will demonstrate how these concepts can be used to predict spectra for isolated (i.e. gas-phase) molecules. We will then extend these concepts to understand how solvents and other environmental influences impact these spectra. Another focus of the course will include explanations of how specific experimental techniques, such as transient and photoluminescence pectroscopy, can be used to understand the efficiencies of specific chemical transformations (e.g. isomerization, electron and proton transfer, dissociation), which are central to reactions in chemical, biological, and materials environments. We will also discuss recent experimental advances that have expanded the spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions of spectroscopic measurements.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCHEM\u00a0452\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM 472: General Biochemistry I\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEM\n\n\n472\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Biochemistry I\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBasic structure and function of cellular components; principles of enzyme kinetics and regulation.  \nCHEM\u00a0472\n General Biochemistry I (3) \nCHEM\u00a0472\n will serve as an introductory course in biochemistry.

Carefully crafted assignments will help enhance the students' mastery of both the theoretical underpinnings as well as practical aspects of data integration. The students will work in teams to solve representative data integration problems drawn from real-world applications. Upon completion of the course, students should be able design, implement, and evaluate data integration solutions to support data intensive applications.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisites at Enrollment: \nDS\u00a0220\n and (STAT/\nMATH\u00a0318\n or STAT/\nMATH\u00a0414\n or STAT/\nMATH\u00a0418\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 330: Visual Analytics for Data Sciences\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n330\n\n\n\n\nVisual Analytics for Data Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe course introduces visual analytics methods and techniques that are designed to support human analytical reasoning with data.  \nDS\u00a0330\n Visual Analytics for Data Sciences (3) Visual analytics is the science of combining interactive visual interfaces and information visualization techniques with automatic algorithms to support analytical reasoning through human-computer interaction. People use visual analytics tools and techniques to synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting data, and to communicate their findings effectively for decision-making. This course will serve as an introduction to the science and technology of visual analytics and will include lectures on both theoretical foundations and application methodologies. The goals of this course are for students to (1) develop a comprehensive understanding of this emerging, multidisciplinary field, and (2) apply that understanding toward a focused research problem in a real-world application or a domain of personal interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nC or better in (\nDS\u00a0200\n or \nSTAT\u00a0200\n) and (\nCMPSC\u00a0122\n or \nCMPSC\u00a0132\n or \nIST\u00a0242\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 340W: Applied Data Sciences\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n340W\n\n\n\n\nApplied Data Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course builds up the students' understanding of data sciences by discussing the fundamental principles in the context of real-world examples, and then shows specifically how the principles can provide understanding of many of the most common methods and techniques covered in previous data science courses. The course features three individual projects as well as a team project spanning the entire course. After taking this course, the students should be able to cover the entire pipeline of a data science project, from problem formulation to data science solutions. That is, start from a data driven problem, identify pertinent datasets to the problem and collect data, reason about the best techniques that should be used to solve the problem, implement algorithms and models, assess performance, and communicate actionable insights through both written reports and oral presentations. As one example, a fundamental principle of data science is that solutions for extracting useful knowledge from data must carefully consider the problem in the real world scenarios. This may sound obvious at first, but the notion underlies many choices that must be made in the process of data analytics, including problem formulation, method choice, solution evaluation, and general strategy formulation. Another fundamental principle is that predictive modeling can both inform and be informed by relevant knowledge (including theories, models, frameworks) of the relevant domains. This principle manifests itself throughout data science: in the specific design of many particular data sciences applications, and more generally as the basis for all intelligent solutions. In this course, this principle will be highlighted by case studies from multiple domains so that students can be inspired to apply this principle to their term projects. Lastly, as most data science projects are delivered as solutions as opposed to software deliverables, the ability for data scientists to communicate their results through concise and actionable insights plays a critical role in a data science project. This course places a particular focus on developing student writing abilities, through formal project reports and presentations. The individual projects will offer an interactive experience for students through feedbacks on their reports provided by the instructor. The term-long project will also train students in writing in a collaborative environment.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nDS\u00a0300\n or \nDS\u00a0435\n) and (\nDS\u00a0310\n or \nCMPSC\u00a0448\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 396: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n396\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, that are supervised on an individual basis and that fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 397: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n397\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 399: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n399\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 402: Emerging Trends in the Data Sciences\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n402\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Trends in the Data Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course exposes and trains students in the analysis of emerging trends in data sciences.  \nDS\u00a0402\n Emerging Trends in the Data Sciences (3) Data sciences is a rapidly evolving field affected by innovations in a variety of technical domains, including data generation, capture, storage, and processing. Staying abreast of new developments can be a daunting task but is critical for success. This course provides an in-depth analysis of a particular innovation, but starts with developing generally applicable skills for analyzing new technologies. In particular, the analytic framework considers the innovation's technical aspects and potential for widespread adoption, but also its social, organizational and policy implications. As a course focused on a new data sciences technology or analytic innovation, it is repeatable. As such, the course enables students to be exposed to the cutting edge of data sciences, supporting a forward looking view of the field for students across the university.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nDS\u00a0220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 410: Programming Models for Big Data\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n410\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Models for Big Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRecommended Preparations: \nDS\u00a0310\n; \nCMPSC\u00a0448\n  This course introduces modern programming models and related software stacks for performing scalable data analytics and discovery tasks over massive and/or high dimensional datasets.

Building on data models covered in \nDS\u00a0220\n, this course will introduce programming models such as MapReduce, data flow supports for modern cluster computing environment, and programming models for large-scale clustering (either a large number of data samples or a large number of dimensions). Using these frameworks and languages, the students will learn to implement data aggregation algorithms, iterative algorithms, and algorithms for generating statistical information from massive and/or high-dimensional data.

Datafication can be a powerful force for good, but it can also do harm-to individuals and society. Oriented primarily around case studies, the course investigates when, why, and how data is collected, analyzed, and used, and explores the ethical stakes of data-driven systems. In addition to diagnosing ethical problems-e.g., invasions of privacy, algorithmic bias, and lack of transparency and accountability-students are asked to think creatively and constructively about how the tools of data science can be used to realize shared ethical and social commitments. The course will be comprised of both \"theory\" and \"lab\" components. The former will contextualize ethical problems, introducing students to ethical theories and frameworks for addressing them. The latter will ask students to put those ideas to work, using the tools of data science to identify examples of ethical issues in data science practice, and proposing means of addressing them.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nDS\u00a0220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS 440: Data Sciences Capstone Course\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 3\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n\nData Sciences Capstone Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 3\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course provides opportunities for students to develop their data science problem solving skills via a semester long group project.

    "description": "s) (GS) (BA). This course teaches microeconomic theory at an intermediate undergraduate level, taking a more mathematical approach. Major components of the course are constrained maximization, the theory of the consumer, the theory of the producer, general equilibrium, market structures, and game theory. The goal of this course is to give the student the fundamentals of microeconomics that will be applied widely to upper level courses in economics. The course begins by developing a model of consumer behavior. This model is extended to derive a consumer's demand for a good, and then numerous applications of this model are investigated, including income and substitution effects of a price change, as well as the determination of relative prices in a general equilibrium framework. The supply side of the market is then discussed. The theory of the firm is developed, and students will explore firm behavior and welfare analysis in various market settings including perfectly competitive markets, monopoly, and oligopoly with strategic interaction between firms. Economics is an analytical subject. Students will learn to use inductive reasoning and other scientific methodology necessary to understand this and other (social) sciences. In short, students will learn to think like an economist. The goal of this course is to extend student understanding of the topics introduced in the principles-level class to the way they are applied in the upper level courses in economics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 302H: Intermediate Microeconomic Analysis (Honors)\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n302H\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate Microeconomic Analysis (Honors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\u00a0302H\n Intermediate Microeconomic Analysis (Honors) (3) (GS) (BA) This course is the honors version of ECON302 and meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. There are two branches within the discipline of economics: microeconomics, focused on the behavior of individual economic actors (consumers, firms, and government) and macroeconomics, focused on economic aggregates (e.g., inflation, unemployment, aggregate economic growth). There are four core courses in economics that are required of all majors and minors: introductory and intermediate courses in microeconomics and macroeconomics. This course is the upper-level core course in microeconomic analysis. Students will learn, at a deeper level than that covered in the beginning microeconomics course (\nECON\u00a0102\n), and with extensive use of calculus, about supply and demand, consumer theory, the theory of the firm, market structure and market power, factor markets, and extensions to consider uncertainty, missing markets, and limited information. Students will develop their skills for analysis of microeconomic issues. The skills learned in this course are necessary for a student to succeed in advanced courses. As such, this course is a prerequisite for a large number of microeconomics-oriented courses at the 400 level.

This course looks at the causes and consequences of business cycles. Students begin by examining key macroeconomic variables, including nominal and real interest rates, nominal and real GDP, unemployment rates, and potential economic growth. A two-period consumption model is also analyzed with the life cycle theory of consumption. Economic models are studied to analyze these topics, and macroeconomic goals for a society are discussed. After acquiring many analysis tools, the course discusses general equilibrium, where formal theories can model a variety of shocks that hit the macroeconomy and the corresponding reactions in a variety of markets. Related topics include the production function, marginal productivity of capital, firm investment, labor demand, labor supply, marginal product of labor, the supply side of the economy, and aggregate demand. After establishing a solid understanding of general equilibrium, students will examine the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the market for reserves, open market operations, and quantitative easing. The course finishes with lessons comparing and contrasting classical economic theory vs. Keynesian economic theory. The strengths and weaknesses of each theory are considered relative to the business cycle data.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 304H: Intermediate Macroeconomic Analysis (Honors)\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n304H\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate Macroeconomic Analysis (Honors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\u00a0304H\n Intermediate Macroeconomic Analysis (Honors) (3) (GS) (BA) This course is the honors version of ECON304 and meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. There are two branches within the discipline of economics: microeconomics, focused on the behavior of individual economic actors (consumers, firms, and government) and macroeconomics, focused on economic aggregates (e.g., inflation, unemployment, aggregate economic growth). There are four core courses in economics that are required of all majors and minors: introductory and intermediate courses in microeconomics and macroeconomics. This course is the upper-level core course in macroeconomic analysis. Students will learn, at a deeper level than that covered in the beginning macroeconomics course (\nECON\u00a0104\n), and with extensive use of calculus, about the measurement and structure of the national economy, long-run economic performance and the factors that influence it, business cycles and macroeconomic policy, and the environment and institutions that are pertinent to macroeconomic policy. Students will develop their skills for analysis of macroeconomic issues and policy. The skills learned in this course are necessary for a student to succeed in advanced courses. As such, this course is a prerequisite for a large number of macroeconomics-oriented courses at the 400 level.

The course will cover topics similar to those covered in \nECON\u00a0306\n but with more mathematical rigor (i.e., using calculus). Following an introduction and reviews of probability and statistics, the course will focus on: (1) the statistical properties of commonly-used estimators and test statistics in regression models, (2) how to use them in practice for statistical inference, and (3) the issue of endogeneity and instrumental variables. Students will study both practical and theoretical aspects of econometrics, by which they will be able to implement the basic methods in practice and to understand the limitations of these methods. This course is an honors version of the second quantitative course in economics that is now required of all economics majors. As noted above, students will learn both theoretical and practical aspects of econometrics, so that they will be able to carry out econometric analyses of data. Evaluation of student performance will be based on homework assignments, midterm exams, and a final exam. Typically, the homework assignments would account for 20 percent of the overall course grade, each of two midterm exams would count for 25 percent of the grade, and the final exam would count for the remaining 30 percent of the grade. This course has \nECON\u00a0106\n/106H, Statistical Foundations for Econometrics, as a prerequisite, and will use calculus. Further, the course is a prerequisite for advanced course work in econometrics, such as ECON 465W, ECON 466W, and ECON 483W, as well as other 400-level courses requiring econometrics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0106\n and (\nMATH\u00a0110\n or \nMATH\u00a0140\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 315: Labor Economics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n315\n\n\n\n\nLabor Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLabor Economics,",

Key questions to consider for the course include: Why do some people earn more than others? When would people choose to work or not? When would someone choose to further his or her education? Do earnings differences necessarily mean discrimination? To answer these questions, students will begin the course by learning the basics of the labor market, including labor demand and labor supply. Employment and earnings are then discussed, including the definition of unemployment, different types of unemployment, and reasons individuals would choose to work or not. Data is used to examine labor market trends and their implications. The course also explores human capital, wage determination, collective bargaining, wage differentials, discrimination, and related government policies. Considerable emphasis will be placed on problem solving and the application of labor economics to selected public policy issues and current economic events. Knowledge and understanding will be assessed through exams, homeworks, and a final project. This course is one of several 300-level electives which can used toward the Economics major and meets requirements for a General Education (GS) or Bachelor of Arts social science course.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 323: Public Finance\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n323\n\n\n\n\nPublic Finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\u00a0323\n, Public Finance (3) (GS) (BA). This course examines contemporary fiscal institutions in the United States, public expenditures, public revenues, and the incidence of major taxes such as the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, and consumption taxes. We also discuss intergovernmental fiscal relations in a federal system of government, and public debt (or deficit financing). We explore the economic rationale for, the current data, and status of the political debate on these topics and others as time permits. Some of the key topics discussed in the lectures include externalities and solutions to market failure associated with them, efficient provision of public goods, and cost-benefit analysis as a nonmarket way to allocate scarce resources. We also devote a substantial amount of time to the market for health care and the role of government in the provision of health care in the United States. In addition to government\u00bfs role in health care, we spend a great deal of time on other major federal government spending programs including social security and a number of spending programs targeted at low income citizens. The later includes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Here, students are expected to critically analyze the major effects of these programs on poverty as well as incentives to work. On the revenue side of public finances, we focus on both the redistributive and efficiency effects of taxation. We discuss the statutory and economic incidence of consumption taxes, the personal income tax, and the corporate income tax. The last part of the course includes two major topics deficit financing and intergovernmental fiscal relations. In the deficit-financing chapter, we focus on the federal government debt. Students learn about the different measures of public debt, which include gross national debt, intergovernmental debt, and debt held by the public. Under intergovernmental fiscal relations, we discuss the delineation of spending responsibilities between the federal and state governments. We also discuss major funding sources for states and local governments in the United States.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 333: International Economics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n333\n\n\n\n\nInternational Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits",

This course applies the knowledge from Introductory of Microeconomics (\nECON\u00a0102\n) and Introductory of Macroeconomics (\nECON\u00a0104\n) into International trade. Students will learn about why nations trade and the effects of trade on both consumer and producer. Some people will gain and some people will lose from trade and students will learn how to measure gain and loss from trade. This class also introduces trade barrier policies imposed by the government such as tariff, quota, subsidy and other commercial policy such as dumping and countervailing duty. The creation of the international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are discussed. Later in the course, the Macroeconomics side of the international trade is discussed as well as the Balance of Payments, which is a way to summarize and measure a countries trade with the rest of the world. Students will also examine some of the basics of the foreign exchange market and the relationship with the interest rates. Toward the end of the course, the lessons will cover the International monetary systems, which include the gold standard, Bretton Woods system, fixed exchange rates, and flexible exchange rates\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n or \nECON\u00a0104\n or \nECON\u00a014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 342: Industrial Organization\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n342\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIndustrial Organization (3 credits) (GS) (BA) Industrial Organization focuses on the study of markets with imperfect competition. After reviewing the Perfect Competition model, the assumptions of that model are systematically relaxed, allowing us to focus on market failures that result, and how they might be remedied. The Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm is followed. The structure of an industry affects the behavior of firms in that industry, which in turn affects the performance of that industry, evaluated from an efficiency standpoint. Much current material is discussed, especially potential mergers in certain industries and how they might affect market outcomes. Attention is given to oligopolies, using game theory as a tool with which to analyze the performance of these types of markets. Pricing strategies, asymmetric information, advertising, and antitrust law are also covered. The course is designed to provide students with a theoretical background with which to understand current market structures and events. Empirical data is discussed to test the models and theories presented in class.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 351: Money and Banking\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n351\n\n\n\n\nMoney and Banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMoney, credit, commercial and central banking, financial intermediaries, treasury operations, monetary policy.

In this course, students learn all about the Federal Reserve and the conduct of monetary policy: both conventional and unconventional. Students will examine many different interest rates and learn how they are determined. Students will study the importance of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and become familiar with business cycles in the US economy since 1970 and the associated Fed policy during these episodes. Term structures of interest rates are analyzed as well as the risk structure of interest rates. The Taylor Rule and various specifications of the Taylor Rule are applied to these topics. Students also study the efficient market theory and the determination of stock and bond prices. The course finishes by engaging students in the topics of futures, options, and futures options and hedging with futures and options.The objective of the course is help students get a better understanding of macroeconomic and monetary topics and policy.

Its coverage of topics overlaps somewhat with the topics covered in \nECON\u00a0315\n, but typically the treatment of the topics considered will be distinctly more rigorous for this 400-level course. The broad areas that will be focused on in the course include labor supply, investment in human capital, labor demand, wage determination, search and unemployment, and earnings inequality. The objective of this course is to introduce students to topics in labor economics with a rigorous and advanced analytical approach. For each topic, the course will consider the underlying theory, pertinent empirical evidence, and implications for public policy. The instructional and educational objectives are to provide students with a strong background in labor economics. This will allow them to take advanced seminar courses in the labor field. This course is an advanced introduction to labor economics, and as such has a prerequisite of either \nECON\u00a0302\n or \nECON\u00a0315\n. In turn, this course will serve as a gateway to advanced seminar courses in labor economics at the 400 level that the Economics Department is in the midst of creating. The course will count toward both the major and the minor in economics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0306\n and (\nECON\u00a0302\n or \nECON\u00a0315\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 413: Economic Growth and the Challenges of World Poverty\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n413\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Growth and the Challenges of World Poverty\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course is for those who are interested in the challenge posed by persistent world poverty. We will address many different poverty related issues and the goal is to examine how economists can contribute to shedding light on the problem of world poverty and providing insights into its alleviation. Among the questions that we will address are: How persistent is the extent of world poverty? Does rapid economic growth help the poor? Why do some countries grow fast and others fall further behind? What is economic life like when living under a dollar a day? How do we deal with the disease burden? Does providing meals in schools help students perform better? Is microfinance overrated? Has globalization hurt or help the poor? Does foreign aid help or hinder the economic prospects of poor countries?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0304\n and \nECON\u00a0471\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 415: The Economics of Global Climate Change\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n415\n\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Global Climate Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEvidence on climate change; economic models of the environment and market failure; cost-benefit analysis of policy options; carbon markets.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n and \nECON\u00a0306\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 417: The Economics of Uncertainty\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n417\n\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUncertainty and Risk as related to finance, insurance, health, labor, industrial organization, and macroeconomics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 422: Applying Monetary Theory and Monetary History\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n422\n\n\n\n\nApplying Monetary Theory and Monetary History\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course provides a framework for the analysis of monetary history. The course objectives are to introduce students to the theoretical framework used by economists to study monetary theory, and to apply that framework in order to explain various monetary systems that have existed in the past. We will examine the empirical evidence, and also consider policy issues in this area. There is scope for re-examining existing analyses of many of those historical systems. Topics discussed in the course include the Federal Reserve control of the money stock, the demand for money, money as part of economic activity, economic indicators and monetary policy, the Lucas critique, interest rates and the frequency at which they are changed, the creation and purpose of central banking, and private banking regulations. Historical monetary events to be discussed include monetary policy before and during the Great Depression, monetary policy during the Great Recession of 2007 - 2009, the gold standard monetary system, the Bretton Woods system, and the termination of these standards. Among all topics, both current and historical, we will examine the incentives of individuals, firms, banks, borrowers, and lenders, and governments as responses to monetary policy changes. Finally, advances in monetary theory based on macroeconomic events, both national and global, will be analyzed. The course will count toward both the major and minor in economics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 425: Economics of Public Expenditures\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n425\n\n\n\n\nEconomics of Public Expenditures\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAnalytic and policy aspects of public expenditure decisions;

This course includes topics that examine the economics of mergers as well as economic policy with regard to mergers. There often are both pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of mergers. In the U.S. the Federal Trade Commission has primary responsibility for assessing the balance between effects. Along with the FTC, the antitrust division of the department of justice can analyze potential mergers using economic data and forecasts with tools such as the HHI and four-firm concentration ratio. Legality of non-competitive markets and mergers is also analyzed using the Clayton and Sherman antitrust acts. Topics discussed related to pro-merger economic effects include reduction in the duplication of costly capital, economies of scale, reducing costs by cutting management, human resources, payroll, and other jobs not directly related to production of output. Further, some firms may contend that they are non-viable as a small business, but can survive as a larger competitor as the result of a merger. Finally, mergers may have positive implications for shareholders who effectively own the company. Negative effects of mergers topics are discussed, including a reduction in the number of competing firms, increase in market power, higher prices, reduction in consumer choice, and increased lobbying power of larger firms. This course examines unilateral effects and coordinated effects as identified in the horizontal merger guidelines. Vertical mergers are analyzed as well, where multiple parts of the production process of a final good come under the same ownership. Econometric issues associated with the measurement of unilateral and coordinated effects are discussed. The course concludes with ex-post merger reviews. This course is an applied microeconomics seminar in the field of industrial organization and will seek to provide students with the analytical methods of both the theoretical and empirical analysis of mergers. The course will count toward both the major and the minor in economics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 460: Issues in Sports Economics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\nIssues in Sports Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEconomic analysis of professional and collegiate sports: organization, input and output markets, the public sector, decision-making, and public policy.  \nECON\u00a0460\n Issues in Sports Economics (3) This course is designed to provide students the opportunity to examine and understand the sports industry. The course integrates the perspectives of various economic areas (i.e., industrial organization, managerial economics, labor economics, public economics) with those of marketing, finance, and accounting into a single approach to industry analysis. It provides students with an appreciation for the unique realities of the professional and amateur sports enterprise. Case studies and assignments are developed so students can apply theoretical and statistical concepts to real sports activities and/or policies. Students have the opportunity to complete case analyses in teams, present their results and suggestions to the class, and respond to questions and critical reviews by their peers.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n.

It has had a major influence on world events, especially during the Soviet period. The Soviet period represents the greatest economic experiment ever undertaken. Russia has had a vast imperial experience, and its economy has proven capable of producing nuclear weapons and space exploration. Yet, its economy remains dependent on natural resources. Russia is a literary, nuclear and geopolitical superpower but not an economic superpower. This juxtaposition is unique. The aim of the course is to provide a review of Russian economic history together with main concepts explaining the peculiarities of economic and institutional development of the country. The course combines historical narrative with formal economic analyses. We will utilize both an economics and a history perspective. We will explore the development of the Russian economy in the Tsarist period, the abolition of serfdom and Russian industrialization before the Russian Revolution, and we will explore the economic history of the Soviet period. We will also explore the interaction of economic history with social history. The course will conclude by examining the myriad economic and social difficulties encountered in transitioning from a socialist to capitalist economy.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n and \nECON\u00a0104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nHIST\u00a0402N\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education -  Integrative: Interdomain\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 474: Experimental and Behavioral Economics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n474\n\n\n\n\nExperimental and Behavioral Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\texperimental methods and experimental design and uses this framework to inform a careful examination of the strengths and limitations of economic theory in explaining actual human behavior in economic situations. When economic theories do not seem to fit the data the course draws on findings from other social sciences such as psychology and sociology to explore reasons for divergence of theory and practice. The content begins with a brief history of experiments in economics. Then it outlines key features of experimental design and an introduction to the basics of game theory, which are commonly utilized in experiments. After establishing the basics, the course investigates decision making under uncertainty and compares how various theoretical explanations predict actual human decisions. We then discuss bargaining experiments and bargaining theory. The course concludes with a description of common behavioral influences and biases in judgment and decision making. There is a common theme throughout the course showing how theory and experiments can be used in conjunction to improve of understanding of economic behavior.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0102\n and \nECON\u00a0104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 475: Migration and Development\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n475\n\n\n\n\nMigration and Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHuman Capital Approach to Migration; Economics of Family Migration; Evidence: Micro and Macro Perspectives; Migration Policies.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0306\n and (\nECON\u00a0302\n or \nECON\u00a0304\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 479: Economics of Matching\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n479\n\n\n\n\nEconomics of Matching\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThere are many resource allocations that are not unilateral decisions but instead require approval from two sides of the market. This course provides the theoretical constructs for the analysis of matching in market environments. Following a review of game theory, the course develops the theory of matching. The topic at large is introduced by the seminal paper in matching \"College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage\" by Gale and Shapley. Other peer-reviewed literature on the topic will be discussed. Topics that follow include economic applications in the areas of employment, marriage, college admissions, human organ donations, medical residents, and other current topics. Within each of these topics, analysis is performed to study the following questions: 1) What are the preferences and incentives of all of the market participants involved in the matching market? 2) What was the method in which matching occurred? 3) Is this end result Pareto efficient and stable? 4) If the result isn't Pareto efficient, could another method or algorithm be used to improve efficiency? 5) Does the efficient outcome yield equal (or near equal) gains to all market participants involved, or is there a large discrepancy in the utility of the participants post-matching? For example, in a marriage matching algorithm, do women end up much happier than men? In medical residencies, do hospitals end up with larger gains than the doctors? Within certain topics, specific models are also discussed, including the Beveridge curve, Cobb-Douglas matching functions, labor market frictions, Nash bargaining games, feasibility sets, disagreement points, egalitarian and non-egalitarian bargaining solutions, and risk aversion. This course is an applied economics course with relevance to the areas of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and labor economics. The course objective is for students to learn the analytical methods for understanding the economics of matching. Students will develop skills in applying matching models and analysis to practical situations. The course will count toward both the major and minor in economics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 480: Mathematical Economics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n480\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMathematical techniques employed in economic analysis; formal development of economic relationships.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nECON\u00a0302\n and \nECON\u00a0304\n and \nMATH\u00a0110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 481: Business Forecasting Techniques\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n481\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Forecasting Techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tA survey of contemporary business forecasting techniques, with emphasis on smoothing, decomposition, and regression techniques.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nSCM\u00a0200\n or \nSTAT\u00a0200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON 483: Economic Forecasting\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECON\n\n\n483\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Forecasting\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tForecasting time series, using linear regression models and econometric software; useful forecasting models; financial and seasonal time series; trends.  \nECON\u00a0483\n Economic Forecasting (3)This course is an applied econometrics course, and will seek to provide students with hands-on experience in forecasting.

The primary thrust of this course is to step beyond our personal experiences with families and place them within a broader social, historical, cultural and economic context. This class will be multi-disciplinary in its approach to the study of American families. However, we will begin with the historical, demographic and social changes that American families have undergone and try to understand some of the causes and consequences of these changes for the developmental life courses of adults and children in families today. Throughout this course we will be particularly concerned with the diversity of American families stressing differences based on gender, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment:",

Issues of social justice and equity play an integral role in defining the questions that Human Development and Family Studies students ask and the solutions that they pursue, as students must account for diverse needs and values based on age, gender, ethnicity and cultural background. Students preparing to work in the field of Human Development and Family Studies must possess the content, pedagogical and professional knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to work in diverse communities. \nHDFS\u00a0345\n is an opportunity for students to explore the relationship between contemporary urban issues and family development. Participants will evaluate urban development from a Human Development perspective and with a critical eye to how urban development has accounted for the distinctive needs of different segments of the public. Therefore, \nHDFS\u00a0345\n incorporates the knowledge of different Human Development and Family Studies theories and social justice paradigms to help students examine urban themes and build their understanding of social justice and family development as related to these themes. Students will learn how urban planning accounts for differences in society, identify different segments of the urban population differentiated by a few diversity constructs (culture, race, SES, gender, etc) and gain awareness of the varying and distinctive needs and concerns of these groups with respect to living in the urban environment. Students will also explore contemporary issues, like modern policing practices, and find resources to develop solutions to social issues or problems. Discussions of policy and moral philosophy will contribute to students' aptitude to plan an appropriate solution with tangible results. Ultimately, students are expected to leave the course with geographically-informed conceptualizations of social justice and insight into how individuals, families and organizations can work within urban communities as collaborators and partners.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Preparations:  \nHDFS\u00a0175N\n or \nHDFS\u00a0129\n or \nHDFS\u00a0239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 395: Internship\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n395\n\n\n\n\nInternship\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised off-campus, nongroup instruction including field experiences, practica, or internships.

Specifically, you will work with various community-based organizations in partnerships set up by the Penn State Faculty that are local exemplars of democratic action with and for youth development, working closely with professionals affiliated with those programs to support their work and learn from them. \nHDFS\u00a0400\n is a community engaged and culture of support course. Community engagement, also called service learning, is a form of reciprocal experiential education wherein students learn through the collaborative process of meeting authentic community needs. High quality community engagement also attempts to affect real, material social conditions; to authentically integrate the work done to meet community needs with the curriculum/course through continuous, critical reflexive and reflective inquiry; and to be a system of praxis (theory - practice) where the inquiry then informs the work participants do, participants' self-concepts, and the practices of the community. The field, reading, in class and written work will reflect these principles\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0175N\n Recommended Preparations: \nHDFS\u00a0345\n or \nENGL\u00a015\n or  CAS 100 or \nHDFS\u00a0239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 401: Project Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation in the Human Services\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n401\n\n\n\n\nProject Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation in the Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tExercises and activities related to the design, planning, implementation and management, and evaluation of projects and programs in the human services.

The course emphasizes the further development of communication skills, diversity skills, team-building skills, critical thinking skills, and technology and leadership skills. Intended to be completed prior to the internship experience, the course will initially focus students' efforts on the identification of a field-based human services project or program, and a setting within which it could be carried out. Subsequently, students will design and plan the project or program, examine and propose effective implementation and management procedures, and incorporate state-of-the art evaluation procedures into the design.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and approval by internship coordinator.

HD FS 416 (\nSOC\u00a0411\n) Racial and Ethnic Diversity and the American Family (3) During the last several decades, the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population has changed dramatically. At end of the 20th century, non-Hispanic whites accounted for less than 75 percent of the U.S. population. While blacks remained the largest minority group, there were nearly as many Hispanics as blacks, and the number of Asians was increasing. Population projections indicate that by the middle of the 21st century, Hispanics will make up nearly one-fourth of the U.S. population. Blacks, Asians, and American Indians together will comprise an additional fourth of the population. The last several decades have also brought significant changes in family life in the United States, including declining rates of marriage, a rising age-at-marriage, an increase in cohabitation, and a dramatic rise in the proportion of births outside of marriage. While these trends in family life have been experienced by all racial and ethnic groups, there is substantial variation in family patterns by race and ethnicity. The course will build on other courses in social inequality and the family. The course does not overlap with any existing courses in the Department of Sociology or with courses offered in other relevant departments.This course will explore the nature and determinants of racial and ethnic variation in family processes in the United States. The student will read articles from major sociological journals and learn to extract major points and issues. He/she will learn to synthesize and critique various arguments on major issues in the field. The student will acquire skills in summarizing and evaluating arguments in essay form. He/she will also develop oral presentation skills. Final grades for the course will be based on class participation, a brief (approximately 5 pages) paper, a group presentation, a midterm examination (essay format) and a final examination (essay format). The course is not required for the Sociology minor or major. However, the course can count as one of the 400-level elective courses in Sociology for the Sociology minor, B.A. or B.S.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n3 credits in SOC\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nSOC\u00a0411\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 417: Biocultural Studies of Family Organization\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n417\n\n\n\n\nBiocultural Studies of Family Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStudy of variability in family organization with an emphasis on cultural and economic factors influencing household organization and family roles.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0129\n and \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and [(\nHDFS\u00a0315\n or \nHDFS\u00a0315Y\n) or (6 credits in SOC or ANTH)]\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 418: Family Relationships\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n418\n\n\n\n\nFamily Relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDynamics of family interaction; effects of parenthood, sibling and intergeneration relationships on family solidarity.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and (\nHDFS\u00a0315\n or \nHDFS\u00a0315Y\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 424: Family Development in an Economic Context\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n424\n\n\n\n\nFamily Development in an Economic Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEconomic conditions influencing family functioning; familial effects on the economy; strategies to enhance work-family relations.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and (\nHDFS\u00a0315\n or \nHDFS\u00a0315Y\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 427: Developmental Sport & Exercise Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n427\n\n\n\n\nDevelopmental Sport & Exercise Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDevelopmental changes in the antecedents and consequences of physical activity across the lifespan.  HD FS (KINES) 427 Developmental Sport & Exercise Psychology (3)Change is constant with physical activity - our reasons for being active change across the lifespan an dour experiences with physical activity change how we view ourselves and those around us. Developmental Sport & Exercise Psychology focuses on developmental changes in the psychosocial antecedents and consequences of physical activity across the lifespan. Specific course objectives include (1) describing theoretical frameworks and methods used to study physical activity-related psychosocial development across the lifespan, (2) describing how self-perceptions develop and influence behavior in movement contexts at different points in life, (3) explaining how contextual factors influence developmental processes associated with physical activity, (4) identifying age-related differences in activity-related antecedents and consequences of physical activity, and (5) developing, reviewing, and critiquing theoretically-grounded interventions to address issues related to developmental processes associated with physical activity across the lifespan. Evaluation will be based on written examinations, submission of a series of reflection papers on reading assignments, a group presentation, and the students' engagement in the class.

HD FS (SOC) 440 Family Policy (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course is designed to provide an in-depth examination of family policy. Students will identify and critically analyze major issues, controversies, and policies that affect families. Attention will be devoted to recognizing both intended and unintended consequences of family policies and understanding policy challenges and trade-offs. Students will gain an understanding of how policies are shaped by both facts and myths, as well as our values. Students will examine historical and current trends in family patterns (e.g., divorce, women's labor force participation, nonmarital births) to understand the implications they hold for individuals, families and society. Students will gain an awareness of the social, economic, historical, legal, and political contexts within which family policies exist and are proposed. Although the main focus is on U.S. family policy, some time will be devoted to learning about family policies in other countries. We will learn about several specific family policies in-depth (e.g., welfare), but a final goal is to help students develop a general way of looking at family policy that they can then use to understand any issue of family policy that unfolds throughout their lifetime. This course will foster thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, writing skills, research skills, and skills of synthesis, logic, and argument. Course goals will be accomplished through course readings, writing assignments, lectures, class discussions, debates and group projects. Mastery of course material and student evaluation are assessed in several ways. Students will take a midterm and final exam that cover lectures, class discussions, and assigned readings. Two papers are also required. The first paper is based on an analysis of newspaper articles dealing with family policy issues that students will collect and relate to course materials. The second paper is a literature-based analysis of a family policy in a society outside the United States. Class participation is also essential and its evaluation will be based on a combination of class attendance, contributions to class discussions, participation in group debates and projects, and an oral presentation of the final paper on a non-U.S. family policy.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n3 credits of SOC or HDFS\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nSOC\u00a0440\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 445: Development Throughout Adulthood\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n445\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Throughout Adulthood\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tProcesses of development and change of behavior from early adulthood through old age, emphasizing theory, method, and empirical research.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS 249 and (\nHDFS\u00a0312W\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0301W\n) and (\nPSYCH\u00a0200\n or",

In considering death-related patterns in society, it explores notable examples like 'human-induced death' (e.g., suicides, accidents and homicides), 'socially sanctioned death' (e.g., violence from war, genocide, and terrorism), and the characterization of death in daily discourse, the media, and present day death rituals. Key issues and questions from the field are discussed at both individual and societal levels, which include the meaning of death, facing death across the life-course, the sociocultural context of death, bereavement and grief, the death industry, and ethical and legal issues surrounding death. Examining the variegated meanings in different social institutional spheres, such as ethics, politics, mass media, and family from a social-scientific perspective, the course helps students recognize and appreciate that death and bereavement are deeply embedded into social and cultural structures of society, including how we learn about death, the typical ways in which our attitudes and beliefs are shaped, and how death and bereavement affect children, adolescents, adults, and older adults. It also addresses issues specific to death/dying in careers Human Development and Family Studies prepares for in terms of death education and bereavement counseling.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nHDFS\u00a0229\n or \nHDFS\u00a0239\n or HDFS 249 or \nPSYCH\u00a0212\n) and \nHDFS\u00a0301\n and (\nHDFS\u00a0312W\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0301W\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 451: Adoption: Policy, Practice, and Experience\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n451\n\n\n\n\nAdoption: Policy, Practice, and Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course introduces students to the concepts, research, and policies associated with historical and contemporary adoption practice. Topics will include adoption policies, practices, and experiences from the viewpoints of birth parents, adoptees, and adoptive parents. Social, emotional, and developmental issues faced triad members throughout the adoption process and lifespan are also examined. For example, students will be guided to consider implications of various adoption arrangements and policies on identity development (e.g. ethnicity/race and transracial adoption; social class and issues of privilege related to adoption; gender, sexuality, and adoption) as well as how historical and contemporary U.S. adoption policies, laws, and practices intersect with issues of social justice and equity.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n6 credits of HDFS or PSYCH or SOC or RHS.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 452: Child Maltreatment Prevention, Intervention, and Legal Issues\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n452\n\n\n\n\nChild Maltreatment Prevention, Intervention, and Legal Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tExamines causes, correlates, and consequences of child maltreatment, empirically supported prevention/intervention programs, the Child Welfare System and relevant legal issues.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nHDFS\u00a0229\n or \nHDFS\u00a0239\n) and \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 453: Family Participation and Involvement in Child Services\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n453\n\n\n\n\nFamily Participation and Involvement in Child Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCurrent and historical perspectives of roles and functions of family members in designing, delivering, and evaluating of child service programs.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0229\n and \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and (\nHDFS\u00a0315\n or \nHDFS\u00a0315Y\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 455: Development and Administration of Human Services Programs\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment and Administration of Human Services Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFundamentals of program development and administration of human service programs in community settings; emphasis given to program content, strategies, and the overall planning process.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0311\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 465: Child Maltreatment: Prevention and Treatment\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n465\n\n\n\n\nChild Maltreatment: Prevention and Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAdvanced examination in approaches for preventing child maltreatment and treating its consequences.  HD FS (CMAS) 465 Child Maltreatment: Prevention and Treatment (3) Child maltreatment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, is a highly prevalent condition affecting nearly one million children each year in the United States alone. This course will delineate the long-term health consequences affecting those who have experienced child maltreatment with an emphasis on those outcomes exerting the greatest impact on overall public health throughout the lifespan. Importantly, a focus on the etiology of such health consequences in the child maltreatment population will be made in order to understand the causal pathways leading to these health consequences. This focus on etiology will serve as a segue into the remaining sections of this course, specifically the prevention and treatment of child maltreatment and its consequences. Universal and targeted prevention programs, where the focus is to prevent an initial instance of child maltreatment from occurring, will be detailed, as will tertiary prevention programs, where the focus is on preventing a re-occurrence of child maltreatment. Similarly, prevention of adverse health outcomes for those affected by child maltreatment will also be covered. Finally, evidenced-based interventions applied with children who have been maltreated and are currently experiencing clinical levels of impairment (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) will be detailed. Identification and rehearsal of treatment components commonly used in prevention and clinical intervention programs will be emphasized. Students successfully completing this course will have direct knowledge of the consequences of child maltreatment and the established methods used in prevention and intervention programs applied with this population.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nCMAS\u00a0258N\n or \nHDFS\u00a0258N\n or \nSOC\u00a0258N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nCMAS\u00a0465\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 467: Autism: Providing Professional Support for Individuals and Families\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n467\n\n\n\n\nAutism: Providing Professional Support for Individuals and Families\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course emphasizes the professional development for students planning to pursue careers in the field of autism. Topics include the stresses and needs of families and siblings of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), vocational and social challenges faced as individuals with ASD age into adolescence and adulthood, and techniques to aid parents in becoming effective advocates for their child's academic, social, and behavioral needs. Although the core symptomatology of ASD and empirically validated interventions are covered as foundational knowledge, these topics are not be the focus of this course. Rather, this course identifies the challenges and strengths likely to be encountered in the lives of families and individuals with ASD and provides current best practices to help clients navigate life with ASD.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nHDFS\u00a0229\n or\u00a0\nHDFS\u00a0239\n) and (\nHDFS\u00a0312W\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0212\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 469U: Family Change in the Global Economy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n469U\n\n\n\n\nFamily Change in the Global Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tExploration of how family life, quality, and structures in each region of the world are affected by the new global economy.  HD FS 469U Family Change in the Global Economy (3) (IL) We know that family life, structure, and practices undergo dramatic change when there are economic and political changes in the society. Economic globalization is unprecedented as a force for social and political change. How is it affecting family life and structures around the world? While we have considerable research on globalization and on family change, there has been little work that connects the two.This is an exploratory seminar that involves locating those linkages and discovering families in each world region are changing as they meet up with global economic forces. As we explore each world region, we will learn about diverse cultures and how they are affected by global forces. In the Americas, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Europe this course uncovers new forms of inequality that are emerging from the global economy and having direct effects on women and families. Through it all, we explore how human action, in the family, the community and the society, struggles for quality of life in a global economic context.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 480: Health Disparities: Context, Causes, and Consequences\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n480\n\n\n\n\nHealth Disparities: Context, Causes, and Consequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn this course, students will explore the role of social and physical environments on individual and familial health and well-being using a social determinant of health framework.

In this preparation course, students focus on developing their professional skillsets well as on their personal internship search. With regard to professional development, students work to integrate their knowledge and skillsets relative to important professionalism topics (e.g. ethical standards and cultural competence). Through the internship development process, students are guided to explore their career goals, map out key skills and knowledge they wish to develop during their internship experience, identify organizations that might serve as internship sites, and ultimately develop an internship arrangement designed with their needs and professional aspirations in mind. Throughout the course, students are also guided to map their next steps through opportunities to do financial, educational, and career planning.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0301\n and \nHDFS\u00a0312W\n and instructor approval.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 492: Palliative Care and Bereavement\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n492\n\n\n\n\nPalliative Care and Bereavement\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPalliative care focuses on enhancing the quality of life for persons with life-limiting conditions and their families throughout potentially curative treatment and disease progression, through assessment and intervention methods that prevent and ease suffering \u00bf biological, psychosocial, and spiritual. From a biopsychosocial perspective, this course provides students with the conceptual, assessment, intervention, and professional skills to assist individuals and families across the lifespan facing illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, dementia, and Parkinson's Disease from the time of a palliative care diagnosis to day of terminal care diagnosis. Additionally, the course applies a holistic viewpoint to the assessment of ecological, social, and psychological factors influencing individual and family well-being in emphasizing best practices in addressing psychosocial stress and grief. This course will cover multiple areas, such as: (1) Psychosocial and spiritual issues, (2) Optimizing quality of life, (3) Strategies to support individuals and families, (4) Ethical and legal issues, (5) Communication, and (6) Interprofessional practice. Focusing on sociocultural and ecological approaches to relationship building and problem-solving, the course emphasizes best practices in patient/client and family-centered methods. The course is designed to foster clinical skills, thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, research knowledge, and skills of synthesis and logic crucial to assisting persons and their families from the healthcare to counseling setting. Students will be asked to participate in role-play simulations, contribute to weekly in-class discussions, develop and analyze case studies, analyze empirical-based literature, complete written assignments, and create a final project.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0129\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n or \nSOC\u00a01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 494: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 494H: Senior Honors Thesis\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n494H\n\n\n\n\nSenior Honors Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-6 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIndependent study under the direction of the thesis advisor of topics related to the interests of the student, culminating in presentation of a thesis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \napproval of honors thesis advisor\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 495A: Internship:  Advanced Experience\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n495A\n\n\n\n\nInternship:  Advanced Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHD FS 495A Internship: Advanced Experience (8) HD FS 495A represents a full-time, one-semester internship experience.

This course can be taken during the fall, spring, or summer semester. Currently, HD FS 495B consists of writing three papers; The Organizational Analysis, The Policy Analysis, and The Personal Development Paper. The purpose of the organizational analysis paper is to give the intern an opportunity to learn about his or her internship setting or organization in greater depth than might be possible otherwise. This will necessitate the intern taking an active approach to systematically securing information about the internship organization through the review of relevant documents, conducting formal or informal interviews, and observation. This paper will then be saved at the internship office, without identifying information or grade, to be viewed as a source of information about potential internship sites by future students who are seeking internships.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0495A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 495C: Professional Practicum in Human Services\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3-8 Credits/Maximum of 8\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n495C\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Practicum in Human Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3-8 Credits/Maximum of 8\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGuided professional practicum in human services, usually in the form of a project related to a human services issue.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nHDFS\u00a0401\n or \nHDFS\u00a0490\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 496: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n496\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 497: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n497\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 498: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n498\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 499: Foreign Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n499\n\n\n\n\nForeign Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual of group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 499A: **SPECIAL TOPICS**\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n499A\n\n\n\n\n**SPECIAL TOPICS**\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 499B: **SPECIAL TOPICS**\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n499B\n\n\n\n\n**SPECIAL TOPICS**\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS 499C: **SPECIAL TOPICS**\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\n499C\n\n\n\n\n**SPECIAL TOPICS**\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nLionPATH\n\n\nCollegeNET\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nPrivacy and Legal Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n            All Rights Reserved.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF of this page\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Complete Bulletin PDFs\nDownload Undergraduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Graduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Penn State Dickinson Law Bulletin PDF\nDownload College of Medicine Bulletin PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel",

Common orthopaedic injuries of all major musculoskeletal structures and tissues are discussed moving up the kinetic chain from the feet up the lower extremities, through the spine and out the upper extremities to the hands. Common injuries such as sprains, strains, fractures, tendinopathies, disc herniations, spinal stenosis, compartment syndromes, neural compression, carpal tunnel syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome will be discussed. Anatomy and function of each body region will be reviewed prior to the discussion of injuries. Mechanisms of injury, tissue pathology and the tissue healing processes are reviewed. The role of inflammation in the healing of injured tissues will be explored and the variations in healing processes between tissues explained. Common surgical procedures for major injuries like anterior cruciate ligament tears will be presented. A general rehabilitation process is discussed and rehabilitation concepts unique to specific injuries are explored. Basic principles of the major components of a rehabilitation program are explained. These major components include the protection of healing tissue, pain control, swelling resolution, restoration of range of motion, facilitation of volitional control, enhancement of muscular strength and endurance, improvement of neuromuscular control, training of functional movement patterns and return to functional activities. The RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) method of treating pain and limiting swelling will be presented. Manual therapy, stretching and exercise activities used to regain range of motion will be explained. Exercises used to improve muscular strength and endurance will be discussed for each region of the body. Methods of facilitating balance and neuromuscular control will be demonstrated. Finally, the benefits of functional exercise in terms of three-dimensional exercise requiring the use of groups of synergistic muscles in a coordinated manner will be presented. In addition, return to sport programs that gradually reintroduce the patient to the real life stresses placed on their injured body part will be explained. Prioritization of addressing the different components of a rehabilitation plan will be discussed and differences between surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation plans presented. Criteria used to make return to play decisions for injured athletes will also be outlined. Modifications of common exercises to accommodate for injuries and allow continued participation in exercise routines will be presented. This course is appropriate for pre-allied health professionals and fitness professionals with an interest in orthopaedic injuries, musculoskeletal system rehabilitation and the construction of exercise programs that prevent, or accommodate for, musculoskeletal problems.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 413W: Movement Science and Pseudoscience\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n413W\n\n\n\n\nMovement Science and Pseudoscience\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe domains of health and fitness seem to be filled with questionable claims for products that are supposed to make us stronger, faster, fitter, and healthier. How should we make decisions about whether to accept these claims? How can we judge (often conflicting) research reports to reach these decisions? What pitfalls are we all subject to when evaluating evidence and drawing conclusions?  This course does not provide ready answers about specific treatments. Instead, the primary goal of this course is to help students develop a set of critical thinking skills that they will take with them into their chosen careers. In this way students will be prepared to make decisions not only about existing treatments, techniques, and practices, but also ones that are yet to appear. Real-world examples that draw on knowledge from multiple areas within kinesiology will be the subjects of class discussions that complement the lectures. A secondary goal of this course is to demystify science and humanize scientists in order to give students a better understanding of how science is done properly and improperly. The boundaries between science and pseudoscience are discussed so that students are better prepared to identify the latter. Making this distinction can be difficult when pseudosciences seem to have many of the hallmarks of actual science without the same rigor, openness, and possibility for progress.  Kinesiology 413 relies on small group discussions with the Instructor and other students in the class. This is also a writing-intensive class, and as such there will be writing assignments focused on the development of tests for a claim, and critical evaluation of claims related to a treatment, device, etc. related to human movement and activity.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n6th Semester standing\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 414: Interdisciplinary Study of Street Medicine\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n414\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Study of Street Medicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course exposes students to the fundamentals of homelessness while incorporating fieldwork in cities across the United States.

Throughout the course students will explore the process for developing and implementing a disability sports program such as, but not limited to, identifying community need, determining budget and funding sources, assessing resources needed, and gaining experience in teaching a sport or recreation for individuals with disabilities. While exploring the development of disability sports students will gain an understanding of key historical, sociocultural, and biomedical issues that are unique to individuals with disabilities. Historical issues such as the treatment of individuals with disabilities within society and sport, and the impact that sport has had on acceptance of individuals with disabilities will be examined. Students will also compare and contrast the major international sports organizations as well as United States sport organizations that are specific to individuals with disabilities. Students will gain an understanding of cognitive, mental, and physical disabilities, and the interaction between disability type and other identities such as gender. These concepts will be emphasized with a variety of hands on experience with disability sports and sport equipment. In addition, students will utilize theory based learning to review key concepts of accessible recreation and sport programs for individuals with disabilities in the United States. Students will also gain an understanding of unique characteristics of individuals with disability, and appropriate adaptations for sport and recreational success. By the completion of the course students will be able to identify major resources and concepts for disability sport and recreation related to coaching, sport management, sports medicine, and program development in the United States. Throughout the course an emphasis will be placed on acquiring knowledge of and concern for inclusion of individuals with disabilities through sport.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0100\n or \nRHS\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 420: Psychosocial Dimensions of Physical Activity\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n420\n\n\n\n\nPsychosocial Dimensions of Physical Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDiscussion of theoretical and empirical findings, structuring a frame of reference for exploring man's involvement in physical activity.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0321\n or 3 credits in PSYCH or SOC\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 421: Exercise Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n421\n\n\n\n\nExercise Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPsychological antecedents and consequences of physical activity behaviors.  \nKINES\u00a0421\n Exercise Psychology (3)Exercise Psychology is designed to introduce students to the psychological antecedents and consequences of exercise behaviors.

The first half of the course will provide an introduction to public health and basic epidemiology, measurement, dose-response relationships, chronic disease prevention. We will examine the historical progression of physical activity as a part of public health, including landmark studies showing the relationships between physical activity and chronic disease morbidity and mortality. Current public health guidelines and national policies related to physical activity will be discussed in detail. Students will debate the scientific foundation for current issues in the field, including fitness vs. fatness as a predictor of health outcomes and comparing behavior vs. objectively measured variables. The role of physical activity in preventing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer, colon and prostate cancer will be discussed. We will focus on large scale epidemiologic studies that highlight prevention. The second half of the class will focus on a social ecological framework for promoting physical activity and will address population level approaches through policy and environmental strategies, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Task Force for Community Preventive Services guidelines. We will study how features of the built environment can encourage or discourage walking and biking and refer to current research in the field that examines these relationships in different populations (urban/rural, youth/older adults). We will learn about the challenges associated with assessment and measurement at a population level. Policy level approaches to physical activity promotion; including local, state and national; will also be discussed. We will discuss various community level approaches including: point-of-decision prompts, mass media campaigns, enhancing access to physical activity opportunities and other strategies outlined in the guidelines. Lastly, we will examine how physical activity promotion is addressed in other countries through community, policy and environmental strategies in Canada, Australia, Brazil and throughout Europe.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment:  \nKINES\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 427: Developmental Sport & Exercise Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n427\n\n\n\n\nDevelopmental Sport & Exercise Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDevelopmental changes in the antecedents and consequences of physical activity across the lifespan.

Notably, athletes and exercisers are commonly structured into tight-knit, interactive, and interdependent groups such as teams, fitness classes, family units, peer groups, neighborhoods, and training groups. These small groups are fundamental to sport and exercise experiences, while also influencing whether or not youth and adults derive value from physical activity. Therefore, identifying and promoting optimal small group environments is a central goal for researchers studying the social psychology of sport. Whereas the construct of group cohesion is the most widely-studied aspect of small groups in this context, rich and emerging lines of research reveal a great deal about group structures (e.g., norms), emergent states (e.g., social identities), and group processes (e.g., teamwork), as well as the outcomes of involvement in groups. This area of research is of general theoretical interest, but is also critical to establish an enhanced practical understanding for fields ranging from coaching to health promotion, education, and psychology. To explore these group processes, the goal of the course entails establishing a foundational understanding of small group dynamics. From this foundation, class members will explore contemporary research and theory about optimizing sport groups (i.e., sport adherence and performance) and physical activity groups (i.e., physical activity maintenance, positive psychosocial perceptions). This exploration will demand that students read and discuss empirical research - demonstrating the capacity to interpret and understand this literature, along with the capacity to critically appraise empirical findings. Students' learning related to group dynamics will be cemented through discussions and activities focused on real-life groups, as well as demonstrations of group processes using group tasks. By the completion of the course, students will have acquired strategies to optimize small group environments and developed skills to communicate group dynamics constructs and theories. Regarding communication, a critical outcome of this writing-intensive course is the capacity to interpret writing from group dynamics experts and communicating these themes through one's own effective writing.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0321\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 431: Concussion in Athletics: Brain to Behavior\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n431\n\n\n\n\nConcussion in Athletics: Brain to Behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNational organizations have identified mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, as a major health concern for injured athletes at high school, collegiate and professional levels.

It is the overall intention of this course to elicit current understanding the pathophysiology, including its underlying mechanisms, predicting differential evolution and consequences of concussion. The central focus of this course is that symptoms following the concussion (e.g., headache, dizziness, balance, gait and locomotion, executive and neurocognitive function deficits etc.) may be exacerbated and /or triggered by compromised integrity of cortical, subcortical, and other areas of CNS. Thus, this concept will be discussed and elaborated throughout the course development.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0321\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 440: Philosophy and Sport\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy and Sport\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAn examination of human nature from the perspective of our participation in sport.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment:  \nKINES\u00a0345\n or 3 credits in PHIL\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 441: History of Sport in American Society\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n441\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Sport in American Society\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMST\u00a0441\n / \nKINES\u00a0441\n History of Sport in American Society study of the background, establishment, and growth of sport in America from colonial times to the present, and the role of American sports in American culture and society.

A.D. 1500 to the present). The course begins with a foray into the transition from traditional to modern forms of sport and society and covers the development of a wide variety of athletic games and pastimes from the sixteenth through twentieth centuries. Students will encounter a variety of historic conceptions of sport and explore the role of sport in the development of European, North American, Latin American, Asian, African and Pacific cultures. Students will learn how sports have been shaped by and have shaped by multiple factors, including modern ideas, science, class structures, gender roles, constructions of race, urbanization, nationalism, political conflicts, international relations, and economic institutions.This is a senior-level course that fills an important historical gap in the Kinesiology Department's sequence of offerings on the history of sport. Other courses in the sequence cover ancient sport, sport in American society, and the Olympic Games. While crucial American developments that impact sports in the modern world are incorporated into this course, this class offers students a global focus that concentrates on the role of sport in societies beyond the borders of the United States. This course also relates to the offerings in the philosophy of sport program by exploring the history of ideas about sport in modern thought. Additionally, the course connects to the science-based offerings in Kinesiology by providing students with and introduction to the history of the scientific study of human performance.The course introduces students to basic readings and knowledge of the history of sport in the modern world. The class provides opportunities to practice the critical reading and thinking techniques that shape the historian's approach to knowledge. This course will be taught once every year with an anticipated enrollment of 50 students. Evaluation methods that test reading and critical thinking skills are employed.

It is also relevant for students in athletic training or those who plan to pursue a career in coaching. The focus of the course is on the identification of issues and stressors affecting the transition and the development of strategies and coping skills to deal with life after sport. This can often be a very emotional and difficult time for student athletes. Discussion is focused on intervention and coping strategies, goal setting, decision making, career planning, and transferable skills. Student athletes will be able to recognize how their athletic experience has helped them to acquire numerous skills and characteristics highly valued in the workplace. Two sections of the course will be offered each semester. Students will be required to submit a weekly reaction paper, do a review of literature, and compile a comprehensive career plan.

These events lead to pivotal questions -What are the broader social and political meanings of sport in African society? And what does the study of sport in Africa tell us about Africa\u00bfs place in world history? This course uses the lens of sport to examine the social and political histories of Africa and the wider diaspora in historical perspective. From the racial and gendered hierarchies of colonialism to the use of sport to protest against social injustices, students are challenged to analyze the interdisciplinary significance of sport far beyond the playing field. One of the main intellectual goals of this course is to use sport to deepen our understanding of specific outcomes in African sport (e.g. South Africa\u00bfs remarkable transformation from pariah of international sport to host of global events like the 2010 World Cup, and Kenyan running successes) from a variety of perspectives. We also consider how Americans travelled to and engaged with African societies as athletes, ambassadors, and activists. Broadly, this course explores sport and social change in Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present. It examines the sporting lives of African athletes, fans, reporters, coaches, and organizers and then connects them to shifting racial identities and power relationships on the continent as well as elsewhere around the world. These histories shed light on the pivotal role of sport in the everyday lives of people across the continent. In the process, we pay attention to primary sources, analyzing the ways in which Africans thought, talked, and represented themes discussed in assigned readings. Ultimately, this course will strengthen student skills of critical thinking, oral communication, collaboration, research, and writing.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0100\n or 3 credits of AFR or 3 credits of HIST\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nAFR\u00a0449\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 452: Applied Cardiovascular Physiology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n452\n\n\n\n\nApplied Cardiovascular Physiology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn-depth study of cardiovascular regulation during postural, environmental, and exercise stress.  \nKINES\u00a0452\n Applied Cardiovascular Physiology (3)First, the course begins with an intensive review of hemodynamics and basic cardiovascular control mechanisms (neural, hormonal, and local regulation). Second, students compare and contrast these general principles in six important circulations: splanchnic, renal, cerebral, coronary, cutaneous, and muscle. Third, they examine the three stresses which affect the circulation: posture (gravity), environment (especially heat) and exercise. For each stress, students identify the regional circulation(s) most affected and how they contribute to an integrated (systemic) cardiovascular response that is unique for each stress. Finally, combinations of posture, heat, and exercise stress are considered to illustrate competing cardiovascular control mechanisms.

This course is designed for students interested in developing a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind exercise as medicine. Course content will consist of a mixture of selected book chapters as well as contemporary review and primary research articles. This course begins with an overview of the current exercise deficiency problem, including the societal, behavioral, and economic changes of the past century which have contributed to the modern day epidemic of chronic inactivity-related disease. After developing an appreciation for the scope of these problems, students will be introduced to the \"tools\" needed to critically evaluate the association between exercise and/or inactivity on health and the mechanisms by which these associations may occur, including: basic principles of epidemiology, searching/reviewing scientific literature, and experimental design. The remainder of the course will be focused on how exercise/physical activity modifies molecular/tissue-level and integrative physiological function, and describes the extent to which these modifications confer either preventative or therapeutic benefit. Students will also use the \"tools\" that they learned at the beginning of the semester to demonstrate and share knowledge with others; integration of this information may include a thorough analysis of a chronic condition including the pathophysiology, strength of evidence for exercise is medicine, and physiological actions of exercise in prevention or treatment. Students may also be given the opportunity to translate their knowledge from this course into educational materials (e.g., flyers, pamphlets, screensavers, fitness center displays, social media, etc) for use during \"Exercise is Medicine\" week.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 456: Physical Fitness Appraisal\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t4 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n456\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Fitness Appraisal\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t4 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn \nKINES\u00a0456\n, students assess the five components of health-related physical fitness through fitness testing measures: body composition, joint flexibility, muscle strength, muscle endurance and cardiorespiratory fitness. The importance of a comprehensive pre-participation health screening, including relevant medical history, physical examination findings, cardiovascular disease risk factor assessment and laboratory testing is emphasized. Several current pre-participation screening instruments are reviewed. The American College of Sports Medicine physical activity guidelines and guidelines for exercise testing and prescription are discussed and grounded in best practices in monitoring signs and symptoms of physical stress leading to test termination. Students explore the role that cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and metabolic disease risk factors and signs and symptoms play in the development of atherosclerosis and the impact each has on fitness appraisal. Modifications and/or alternative assessments for each health-related component of physical fitness are discussed for clinical populations, children and older adults. The required laboratory allows students practical opportunities to assess these components across the lifespan utilizing both field testing and laboratory testing and interpreting results using normative data. The required laboratory experience reinforces the course content and aids in skill acquisition by requiring that all students participate in the testing procedures as both test administrators and subjects. As EKG interpretation is a valuable skill in fitness appraisal, students receive instruction in basics of EKG interpretation to include: determination of mean electrical axis, heart rate and rhythm, EKG waveform norms, and normal and abnormal EKG responses before, during and after exercise testing. Atrial, junctional and ventricular arrhythmias, heart blocks and bundle branch blocks are included in the latter portion of the course. ACSM metabolic calculations for exercise testing and prescription are reviewed and utilized.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 457: Exercise Prescription and Case Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n457\n\n\n\n\nExercise Prescription and Case Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinciples of exercise prescription; application of fitness appraisal based on current practices using evaluation and discussion of case studies.  \nKINES\u00a0457\n Exercise Prescription and Case Studies (3) The major purpose of this course is to provide those students interested in allied medical careers (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation, hospital testing, wellness centers, corporate fitness centers, physical therapy) with skills and practical knowledge regarding exercise diagnostics and prescription. Particular emphasis is placed on clinical diagnostic procedures, interpretation and terminology and this course directly contributes to the knowledge base expected for future employment in this area. At the conclusion of \nKINES\u00a0457\n, the students will be able to demonstrate on written examinations and in discussions, a knowledge and understanding of basic exercise prescription principles for apparently healthy, at risk and diseased populations, with special- emphasis on the cardiac patient. Inherent in the course goals is an understanding of the chronic physiological adaptations that occur as a result of programs of endurance and resistance exercise in apparently healthy, at risk and diseased populations.This course includes lectures as well as hands-on laboratory sessions. Evaluation is based on student performance on written examinations, written and oral case study presentations, and written assignments. This course will be taken after students have completed \nKINES\u00a0456\n and will complete the learning scheme involving fitness appraisal and subsequent prescription of exercise programs.The course is offered fall and spring semesters with an enrollment of 35 students.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0350\n and \nKINES\u00a0456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 458: Introduction to Electrocardiogram Interpretation\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n458\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Electrocardiogram Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReading and interpreting electrocardiograms are important skills for an exercise physiologist and many other allied health care practitioners. This skill features prominently in the job task analyses for industry certifications. The electrocardiograph is an instrument that measures electrical potentials on the body surface and generates a record of the electrical currents associated with heart muscle activity. The graphic record generated by the electrocardiograph is called an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). The EKG provides information about the rhythm and rate of contraction of heart muscle and the strength, timing and direction of electrical signals as they pass through various areas of the heart. Specific abnormalities of rate and rhythm will produce recognizable patterns in the EKG waveforms. This course will begin with cardiac anatomy and cardiac action potential production and conduction. The course material will progress through normal EKG patterns through common abnormalities in various areas of the heart as well as patterns related to infarction, acute injury and ischemia. The hemodynamic consequences of these abnormalities will be discussed. The effects of exercise, prescription medications and other drugs on the EKG will be explored. Successful completion of this course does not grant the authority to provide a medical diagnosis based upon an EKG interpretation; only a physician can do so\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0350\n or \nBIOL\u00a0163\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 459: Community Engagement and Outreach in Kinesiology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n459\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Engagement and Outreach in Kinesiology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCommunity outreach and engagement are two missions of the Department of Kinesiology.

The course addresses the neurobiological foundations of motor deficits in stroke, including contralesional and ipsilesional effects, current research on mechanisms of motor recovery, and the most current research on intervention strategies, such as constraint induced therapy, robot aided rehabilitation, virtual reality therapy, and sensory motor interventions. The purpose of the course is to provide an understanding of the neurophysiological and biomechanical foundations of motor deficits that occur with stroke, and of current treatment approaches. Stroke presents a significant social problem that is emphasized in current statistics reported by the American Heart Association indicating that each year, about 780,000 people in the United States experience a new or recurrent stroke. While stroke can produce deficits in perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes, this course is focused on sensorimotor deficits and associated rehabilitation interventions that tend to be employed by physical and occupational therapists in the rehabilitation environment. Sensory-motor strokes often result in weakness and deficits in voluntary movement of the limbs on the opposite side of the body as the damaged hemisphere (Contralesional). These motor deficits currently receive primary focus in occupational and physical therapy treatment for stroke. However, regardless of improvements in contralesional arm function, most patients also show deficits in coordination of the ipsilesional arm that is on the same side of the body as the damaged hemisphere. For many hemiparetic patients, functional recovery relies heavily on this arm. This class will focus on understanding both ipsilesional and contralesional motor deficits in stroke. Physiological and biomechanical mechanisms of dysfunction will be emphasized. Recovery of function will be addressed through analysis of physiological and biomechanical measures that are used to track changes in neural function. In addition, current research that is focused on developing rehabilitation intervention protocols that systematically address remediation of dysfunction, and facilitation of recovery will be discussed. Students will be guided in reading, critiquing, and presenting primary scientific manuscripts and review articles. Active discussions of presented material are encouraged, and grades are based on presentations, quizzes, and participation in class.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 467: The Science of Performance Enhancement\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n467\n\n\n\n\nThe Science of Performance Enhancement\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEvidence-based evaluation of performance enhancing substances and methods in sport.  \nKINES\u00a0467\n The Science of Performance Enhancement (3) Students will describe and evaluate the evidence base for substances and methods used to improve aerobic power, strength, body composition, metabolism and thermoregulation as they relate to exercise and physical activity.

The course will begin with the basics of writing a comprehensive health education lesson plan and will progress to developing increasingly complex written communications and oral presentations.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nStudents must have a grade of C or better in: \nEDPSY\u00a010\n and \nKINES\u00a0100\n and \nKINES\u00a0101\n and \nKINES\u00a0295B\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n Concurrent: \nKINES\u00a0366\n and \nKINES\u00a0395A\n and \nKINES\u00a0400\n and \nKINES\u00a0464\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 470: Genetics and Human Physical Performance\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n470\n\n\n\n\nGenetics and Human Physical Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHuman genetic variation is ubiquitous and important functionally. How genetic profiles, such as those leading to a high proportion of fast muscle fibers, combined with individualized training environments underlie peak performances will be examined. Similarly, when genetic predispositions are known, lifestyles can be optimized for health through the lifespan. Several hundred genetic loci influence physical performance and health, while allelic variants influencing elite athlete status and/or unusual longevity are about an order of magnitude lower. Only a few individual genetic loci and alleles are associated consistently with elite athletic performance and healthful longevity; many traits important for competitive maxima and general health are multifactorial, involving numerous loci and environmental factors. Each sport has unique physical requirements. Therefore, any study of a favorable genetic background for a given sport should consider the performance components most appropriate. Athletic performance is a complex human trait, involving interaction of multiple body systems (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, etc.). These include morphology (height and body composition), with specific physiques naturally suited to specific sports. Endurance, strength, and power are other factors underlying athletic performance. Additional complexities affecting athletic performance include cognitive factors and injury susceptibility. Environmental factors (including training and nutrition) also influence various traits. An individual's \"trainability,\" or response to exercise training itself also is dependent partially on genetic factors. The relative importance of environment versus genetic factors in athletic success varies widely among sports. Consequently, elite athletic performance as well as long term health result from interactions among genetically-based physical, and appropriate good environments. This course is focused on preparing students with basic knowledge on how the field of genetics can influence sport and athletic performance, fitness outcomes and health.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisites at Enrollment: \nBIOL\u00a0161\n and \nBIOL\u00a0163\n and \nKINES\u00a0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 471: MOTOR CONTROL\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 3\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n471\n\n\n\n\nMOTOR CONTROL\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 3\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAnalysis of the mechanisms underlying the neural control and coordination of voluntary movements. Within this course, the students will get an in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the neural control and coordination of voluntary movements. The course will include content on the history of movement studies, classical research, and main current theories in the field of motor control. These will include theories based on ideas of motor programming and internal models, control with muscle activation patterns, equilibrium-point control, optimization, dynamic systems, and theory of synergies. The neural control of several everyday motor behaviors will be discussed such as vertical posture, locomotion, reaching, and prehension. Speed-accuracy and speed-difficulty trade-offs and changes in motor control and coordination with practice will be described emphasizing plasticity within the central nervous system. Changes in motor control with healthy aging and fatigue will be discussed. In addition, changes in motor control and coordination will be discussed based on the reviewed theories. The role of specific structures within the central nervous system in motor control will be reviewed with an emphasis on movement disorders associated with dysfunctions of specific structures such as spinal cord injury, stroke, disorders of the basal ganglia and of the cerebellum.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 481W: Scientific Basis of Exercise for Older Adults\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n481W\n\n\n\n\nScientific Basis of Exercise for Older Adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStudy of age-associated physical changes and the effects of exercise on the aging process.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 483: Motor Patterns of Children\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n483\n\n\n\n\nMotor Patterns of Children\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDevelopment of motor patterns.

Walking has been described as the most commonly performed human activity. Diseases or injuries that reduce the ability to walk independently and efficiently are especially likely to adversely affect quality of life. \nKINES\u00a0488\n introduces students to the elements of normal walking and how walking motions are affected by changes in age, walking speed, and pathological conditions. Advanced topics covered in this course include other forms of locomotion, including running and cycling, and the use of mathematical models to understand phenomena related to locomotion. Students enrolled in this course learn the particulars of human locomotion, but in so doing they also gain an understanding of kinematics and kinetic analysis, joint mechanics, and the clinical treatment of movement disorders. Basic principles of mechanics are applied to establish how walking motions result from forces produced by muscles, gravity, and contact with the ground. Students planning to pursue graduate study in movement biomechanics or in clinical areas such as physical therapy are especially likely to benefit from the focus on these areas. Laboratories introduce students to current experimental methods used to measure motions, forces, and muscle activity during locomotion. Completion of several case studies during the semester gives students practical experience with the interpretation of motion analysis data, the factors that influence clinical decisions in the treatment of movement disorders, and ethical considerations in biomechanics research.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nKINES\u00a0384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES 491W: Research Proposal\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINES\n\n\n491W\n\n\n\n\nResearch Proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course prepares students to propose a research project in the field of Kinesiology.

Basic high school geometry is assumed; axioms are mentioned, but not used to deduce theorems. Approach in development of the Euclidean geometry of the plane and the 3-dimensional space is mostly synthetic with an emphasis on groups of transformations. Linear algebra is invoked to clarify and generalize the results in dimension 2 and 3 to any dimension. It culminates in the last part of the course where six 2-dimensional geometries and their symmetry groups are discussed. This course is a a part of a new \"pre-MASS\" program (PMASS)aimed at freshman/sophomore level students, which will operate in steady state in the spring semesters. This course is directly linked with a proposed course Math 313R, its 1-credit recitation component. It is highly recommended to all mathematics, physics and natural sciences majors who are graduate school bound, and is a great opportunity for all Schreyer Scholars. The following topics will be covered: Euclidean geometry of the plane (distance, isometries, scalar product of vectors, examples of isometries: rotations, reflections, translations, orientation, symmetries of planar figures, review of basic notions of group theory, cyclic and dihedral groups, classification of isometries of Euclidean plane, discrete groups of isometries and crystallographic restrictions. similarity transformations, selected results from classical Euclidean geometry}; Euclidean geometry of the 3-dimensional space and the sphere (distance, isometries, scalar product of vectors, planes and lines in the 3-dimensional space, normal vectors to planes, classification of pairs of lines, isometries with a fixed point: rotations and reflections, orientation, isometries of the sphere, classification of orientation-reversing isometries with a fixed point, finite groups of isometries of the 3-dimensional space, existence of a fixed point, examples: cyclic, dihedral, and groups of symmetries of Platonic solids, classification of isometries without fixed point: translations and screw-motions, intrinsic geometry of the sphere, elliptic plane: a first example of non-Euclidean geometry); Elements of linear algebra and its application to geometry in 2, 3, and n dimension (real and complex vector spaces. linear independence of vectors, basis and dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalizable matrices, classification of matrices in dimension 2: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic matrices, orthogonal matrices and isometries of the n-dimensional space); Six 2-dimensional geometries (Projective geometry, affine geometry, inversions and conformal geometry, Euclidean geometry revisited, geometry of elliptic plane, hyperbolic geometry). The achievement of educational objectives will be assessed through weekly homework, class participation, and midterm and final exams.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nMATH\u00a0140H\n and \nMATH\u00a0311M\n or Concurrent: \nMATH\u00a0312H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 316: Upperclass Seminar: Careers, Graduate Study, and Opportunities in Mathematics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n316\n\n\n\n\nUpperclass Seminar: Careers, Graduate Study, and Opportunities in Mathematics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course is designed to prepare sophomore, junior and senior mathematics majors to take advantage of opportunities provided by the mathematics department and university in selecting and pursuing a career path.

Several basic physical phenomena are considered - including flows, vibrations, and diffusions - and used to derive the relevant equations. The fundamentals of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations are motivated and developed for the students through the systematic exploration of these classic physical systems and their corresponding equations: the Laplace, wave, and heat equations. In addition to treating the physical origins of the equations, this course focuses on solving evolution equations as initial value problems on unbounded domains (the Cauchy problem), and also on solving partial differential equations on bounded domains (boundary value problems). There is not one but many techniques for solving these equations, and the course presents some aspect of the expansion in orthogonal functions (including Fourier series), eigenvalue theory, functional analysis, and the use of separation of variables, Fourier transforms, and Laplace transforms to solve PDEs by converting them to ordinary differential equations. This course currently serves a cross-section of students at the university with interests or the need for this advanced subject mathematics, including students majoring in the engineering program, meteorology, physics, and mathematics. This typically includes the most advanced physics, engineering, and meteorology students, as well as mathematics majors with interests in applied mathematics.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nMATH\u00a0230\n and (\nMATH\u00a0250\n or \nMATH\u00a0251\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 414: Introduction to Probability Theory\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n414\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Probability Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSTAT(MATH) 414 is an introduction to the theory of probability for students in statistics, mathematics, engineering, computer science, and related fields.

Projective equivalence, singular points, classification of cubics.  \nMATH\u00a0437\n Algebraic Geometry (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The geometric study of algebraic equations is one of the oldest and deepest parts of mathematics, and it lies at the heart of modern developments in geometry, algebra, number theory and physics. Students completing \nMATH\u00a0437\n will understand many new algebraic and geometric ideas by studying examples of curves defined by equations of degrees 2 and 3 in the plane. Fist come conics (given by equations of degree 2 in two variables). Rigid motions, similarities, and affine transformations give different classifications of them. New ideas then show how to get a conic through any five points and prove Pascal's theorem about six points on a conic. Special cases suggest extension of the usual plane to the projective plane, with \"points at infinity,\" homogeneous coordinates, and projective transformations.The main part of the course turns to equations of degree 3 and their singularities, flex points, tangents, and degeneracies. Several new ideas, both algebraic and analytic, are brought in to prove the existence of complex flex points on singular cubics and then real flex points on nonsingular real cubics. There is then a classification on complex projective cubics by a single parameter and finally a full classification of all real projective cubics.As time permits, relations to further topics are sketched: addition of points on a nonsingular cubic, Mordell's theorem, doubly periodic functions, and Fermat's last theorem.The course is typically taken by mathematics majors.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(\nMATH\u00a0230\n or \nMATH\u00a0231\n) and \nMATH\u00a0311W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 441: Matrix Algebra\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n441\n\n\n\n\nMatrix Algebra\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDeterminants, matrices, linear equations, characteristic roots, quadratic forms, vector spaces.

This course will develop the mathematical techniques needed to investigate such differential equations. These techniques include the study of equilibria, stability, phase plane analysis, bifurcation analysis and chaos. The course will assume prior knowledge of ordinary differential equations at the \nMATH\u00a0250\n/251 level; this is the only prerequisite for the course. We will focus on understanding and interpreting the behavior of the solutions to the differential equation models rather than on deriving the model equations themselves. Evaluation will be based on midterm exams, a final exam, graded homework, and graded longer projects which may involve computer work. The course should be of interest to any science or engineering major and some models will be chosen to reflect the fields of interest of the class. The goal is for the students to be able to apply the techniques learned in the course to mathematical models that they will encounter in other classes or situations. The class will be offered every other year with an expected enrollment of 10-15 students.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nMATH\u00a0250\n or \nMATH\u00a0251\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 450: Mathematical Modeling\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n450\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Modeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tConstructing mathematical models of physical phenomena; topics include pendulum motion, polymer fluids, chemical reactions, waves, flight, and chaos.  \nMATH\u00a0450\n Mathematical Modeling (3) The purpose of the course is to introduce mathematical modeling, i.e., the construction of mathematical structures which capture relevant physical phenomena. The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course should be accessible to students with some basic knowledge of mathematical analysis and differential equations. Main topics include: modeling with ordinary differential equations; bifurcation theory and stability; traveling waves in epidemics, chemical reactions, free fluid surfaces, and polymer solutions; fluctuations in nature, stochastic differential equations and chaos.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \n(MATH 315 and \nMATH\u00a0430\n) or \nMATH\u00a0405\n or \nMATH\u00a0412\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 451: Numerical Computations\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n451\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Computations\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tALGORITHMS FOR INTERPOLATION, APPROXIMATION, INTEGRATION, NONLINEAR EQUATIONS, LINEAR SYSTEMS, FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM, AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS EMPHASIZING COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES AND IMPLEMENTATION.

Logic forms the foundation of all mathematical reasoning. To prove a mathematical theorems, one deduces them step by step from basic principles, called axioms, or from other statements previously deduced. Each step of a proof has to be a logically valid rule, such as, for example, the modus ponens: \"If A holds, and A implies B, then B holds.\" In Math 457, students will learn how concepts such as axiom, theorem, proof, and truth can be formulated as a mathematical theory, that is, logical reasoning will be studied as a mathematical subject. The simplest kind of logical system is propositional logic. Here, the basic components are whole statements which are either true or false, and which can be combined using logical connectives such AND, OR, or NOT to form new statements. Its simple nature makes propositional logic a good system to introduce many of the basic ideas: syntax and semantics, proof systems, completeness and compactness. However, propositional logic does not capture mathematical reasoning adequately. Therefore, one considers (first-order) predicate logic. Students will learn how formulas are formed according to syntactical rules. They will also study how a mathematical theory is defined as a set of formulas, how a proof is formally defined, and what constitutes a proof system. The syntactical notions above are contrasted with mathematical semantics, which considers structures over which formulas can be interpreted. This way, one can rigorously define whether a formal statement is true in a given mathematical structure, in which case we say the structure is a model of the statement. For example, the integers with addition are a model of the statement \"for every x there exists a y such that x+y =0\". A central goal of mathematical logic is to explore how the syntactical side (formulas, axioms, proof systems) and the semantical side (mathematical structures such as the additive group of integers) interact. Two fundamental results in this regard will be covered: the completeness theorem says that one can prove a statement from a set of axioms if and only if the statement is true in any structure satisfying all axioms. The compactness theorem, in turn, is an important consequence of the completeness theorem. It has profound implications for the existence and construction of mathematical structures. Students who would like to enroll in Math 457 are required to have some knowledge of mathematical proofs as provided in Math 311W.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 465: Number Theory\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n465\n\n\n\n\nNumber Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tElements, divisibility of numbers, congruences, residues, and forms.  \nMATH\u00a0465\n Number Theory (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This course serves as an upper-level introduction to the fundamentals of elementary number theory. A major emphasis in the course is placed on the role that the prime numbers play in the study of properties of the integers along with the related topics of divisibility and factorization of integers. Additional topics covered in the course include congruences (and the theorems of Euler and Fermat which are classics in this area), properties of arithmetic functions including those which are multiplicative, and other topics such as Pythagorean triples and representations of numbers as sums of squares. This course is completed by a wide variety of students across the university, especially those majoring in mathematics. (In many of the options in the MTHBS degree, \nMATH\u00a0465\n can be used to satisfy one of the major requirements.)

Development in algebra, geometry, arthimetic and calculus will be discussed.A second goal is to help students understand the importanct of written communication in mathematics and to provide opportunities for students to improve the quality of their writing. The primary means for accomplishing this goal will be four papers, 4-8 pages in length. These will be written for an audience of mathematically-knowledgeable readers. In addition, each quiz will contain at least one essay question.Students will be evaluated on quizzes, homework, papers, and a final exam. Quizzes will total 250 points, the papers 200 points, and the final exam 150 points.This course is a required course in the Mathematical Science (MA SC) BS curriculum. This course is also available as an elective for students in the Computer Science (COMP) program.No special facilities are required for this course.

The course significantly expands upon the introduction to Special Relativity (SR) seen in \nPHYS\u00a0237\n, including discussions of experimental tests of SR and applications to relativistic mechanics. It then introduces students to the mathematical machinery required to understand General Relativity (GR), starting with the description of curved spacetimes and geodesics. It discusses solutions to the Einstein equations and surveys the classic tests which established the validity of General Relativity. It concludes with applications of GR in such areas as black hold physics, the generation and detection of gravitational waves, other topics (such as cosmology, relativistic astrophysics, etc.).\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPHYS\u00a0237\n and \nPHYS\u00a0400\n and \nPHYS\u00a0419\n and (\nMATH\u00a0250\n or \nMATH\u00a0251\n) and (\nMATH\u00a0230\n or \nMATH\u00a0231\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nPHYS\u00a0479\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 482: Mathematical Methods of Operations Research\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n482\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Methods of Operations Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSurvey of linear and nonlinear programming; mathematics of optimization; queues; simulation.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nMATH\u00a0220\n and \nMATH\u00a0230\n and STAT 301\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 484: Linear Programs and Related Problems\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n484\n\n\n\n\nLinear Programs and Related Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to theory and applications of linear programming; the simplex algorithm and newer methods of solution; duality theory.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nMATH\u00a0220\n and (\nMATH\u00a0230\n or \nMATH\u00a0231\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Quantification\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH 485: Graph Theory\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATH\n\n\n485\n\n\n\n\nGraph Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to the theory and applications of graphs and directed graphs.

Or have the past two centuries-with the development of industrial mechanization, the computer, and now the Internet-marked a radical shift of some kind? This course will explore the philosophy of technology in more focused and rigorous ways than the department's lower-division course, \nPHIL\u00a0107\n, seeking to understand the way in which technology is transforming our relationships to ourselves, to other people, and to our world.

Typical issues include the distinction between beauty, sublimity, and ugliness; the nature of aesthetic experience and artistic value and their relation to knowledge; the basis and validity of aesthetic judgments; the relationship between art, morality, and society; and the influence of social identities (race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, etc.) on the production and reception of art. In addition to familiarizing themselves with theoretical approaches, students will typically also engage in the discussion and critical interpretation of specific artworks (e.g. paintings, sculptures, photographs, films, musical compositions or performances, literary works), both as a way of exemplifying particular aesthetic issues and approaches, and with a view to enhancing students\u00bf aesthetic perception and experience.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, including \nPHIL\u00a0109\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level, or 3 credits of art   or 5th semester standing\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 410: Seminar in Philosophy of Science\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n410\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Philosophy of Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course reviews the development of philosophy of science in the past century and studies its development once it turns its attention to modern cosmology and biology in this century. We begin with the Vienna School, which took physics to be the most important science, and analyzed deductive thought by means of predicate logic. Then we will look at the work of Thomas Kuhn, who insists on the importance of the history of science for philosophy: we must look at how the sciences develop over time. This makes biology especially interesting: we begin with Darwin, and trace developments to the discovery of DNA and the importance of genetics, and consider the way biology combines the microscopic, the macroscopic, and the study of biological systems. This leads science to interact with politics, as the issue of global warming becomes apparent. How does theory intersect with practical deliberation? The development of modern cosmology also reminds us that the whole universe has a history, and changes our sense of our environment. So it seems that the philosophy of science must include not just deductive thought, but also historical thought and practical deliberation.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy; or 6 credits of philosophy where at least 3 credits are from PHIL 011 or \n110\n; or 6 credits in philosophy where all are at the 200-level.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 413: Seminar in Philosophy of Literature\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n413\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Philosophy of Literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course builds on its precursor (\nPHIL\u00a0113\n) to provide a deeper, more focused perspective on specific topics and issues, for example the nature of fiction and its relation to fact, the value of literary works of art (aesthetic, cognitive, educational, and social), and the nature and proper norms of literary interpretation, translation, analysis, and historiography.

Though the course will typically focus on one or a few selected questions, these may range as broadly as the field itself, for example: how and to what extent is religious faith compatible with reason, scientific rationality, and our knowledge of history? Are there universal types of religious experience and what is their human value and objective significance? Are religion and morality mutually independent or does one rest on or constrain the other? Arguments concerning the existence of God, the interaction between religion, society, and politics, and religious pluralism are further possible topics. Beyond gaining familiarity with canonical texts and honing their skills as critical readers and writers, students will find opportunities to reflect both on religion\u00bfs historical, social, and moral significance as a dimension of human life, and on the specific challenges it raises.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, including \nPHIL\u00a0124\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level or 5th semester   standing\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 425W: Seminar in Epistemology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n425W\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Epistemology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe nature of cognition and perception, the conditions of experience, and the justification and truth of belief.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, including \nPHIL\u00a0125\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level; in addition to \nENGL\u00a015\n or \nENGL\u00a030H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 426W: Seminar in Metaphysics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n426W\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Metaphysics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tExamines the nature of reality, the existence of freedom, and the nature of matter, mind, and values.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits in philosophy, including \nPHIL\u00a0126\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWriting Across the Curriculum\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 427: Seminar in Philosophy of Mind\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n427\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Philosophy of Mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe nature of the mind and its relation to the physical world is the focus of this course, which builds on its precursor (\nPHIL\u00a0127\n). Topics include the definition of consciousness, what constitutes a self, and whether artificial constructions like robots could have minds. Views on these topics, as formulated by a range of (largely twentieth-century) movements - logical behaviorism, functionalism, (physicalist) reductionism, eliminativism, dualism, mind-brain identity theory, and enactivism - have significant metaphysical and ethical consequences. If consciousness is separate from the body, physical theories of causation cannot explain the effect of thought on action. If robots can have minds, there are reasons to be concerned about exploitation of robots as well as the possibility of robot domination. Students will investigate these topics in greater depth, typically either by selecting one or two for careful study or by focusing on the thought of one or two selected authors, e.g., Ryle, Smart, Millikan, Fodor, Block, Churchland, and Chalmers. Texts will challenge students to read and analyze contemporary and historical scholarly work on the topic. The issues discussed will encourage reflection on the assumptions students have about themselves and how their minds shape and are shaped by the world.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy; or 6 credits in philosophy where three credits are from \nPHIL\u00a0127\n; or 6 credits in philosophy where both are at the 200-level\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 432: Medical and Health Care Ethics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n432\n\n\n\n\nMedical and Health Care Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course examines ethical, social, legal, and policy issues related to the research, implementation, and practice of medicine, medical technologies, and healthcare.

How did science and religion emerge as distinct ways of understanding the universe? Were the two always in conflict? What is the nature of this conflict - is it historical, cultural, conceptual, linguistic, or methodological? Are there ways to make them compatible? Do they constitute separate realms with clear-cut borders and jurisdictions? In pursuit of wellinformed answers to these questions, the specific topics of this course will typically include modern scientific conceptions of the natural world and human life (e.g., cosmology, the origin and value of life, evolution) and the contemporary impact of these conceptions on religious belief; ethical questions stemming from scientific methods and biotechnology (e.g., cloning and genetic engineering and the religious responses to such acts of \"playing God\"), and examples of contemporary scientific approaches to explaining religious experience (e.g., cognitive science, neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology).

Feminist philosophy encompasses a broad range of inquiry, from political and ethical issues to foundational metaphysical and epistemological problems - e.g., What is a woman? What is the relationship between knowledge, epistemology, and power? Feminist philosophical approaches are diverse and include thinkers from all approaches to philosophy and are often richly influenced by work in women of color feminisms (e.g., intersectionality, Latinx), approaches to sexuality studies (e.g., LBGT studies and Queer Theory), post- and decolonial studies, and disability studies. Assigned readings will typically offer a range of approaches to feminist philosophy. While a majority of the readings will cover issues discussed by contemporary thinkers, a few historically significant feminist philosophers will often be included. Through reading and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the central approaches to feminism, some of the most pressing issues, as well as the central controversies of feminist philosophy.

The twentieth century is marked by a parting of the ways among rival (and often mutually hostile) approaches with distinct questions, styles, and agendas. Analytic philosophy of language emerges as a synthesis of Frege\u00bfs formal logic with an empiricist theory of meaning; its early proponents (e.g., Russell, Moore, Carnap) aim to expose much of traditional philosophy as futile engagement with \"pseudo-problems\" and replace it a logically perfect language in which genuine problems can be posed and scientifically resolved. Phenomenology (e.g., Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) and existentialism (e.g. Heidegger, Sartre) revolt against the nineteenth century's overblown metaphysical systems and assert the importance of returning to an intuitive engagement with \"things themselves\" and with the lived experience of the human condition. Critical theory (e.g. Benjamin, Adorno) emerges as a synthesis of Marxism, aesthetic criticism, psychoanalytically informed sociology. Around mid-century, each of these streams of thought undergoes a period of crisis and renewal, associated with names such Wittgenstein and Quine in the case of analytic philosophy, Derrida, Foucault, and Deleuze in that of phenomenology and existentialism. Newly emergent critical philosophies such as feminism and decolonial thought heighten the sense of intellectual ferment. Students will emerge from the course both with a deepened understanding of one or more of twentieth century philosophy's key concerns (e.g., language and logic, history, power, the structure of reality, the nature of value and normativity, the relation of theory and practice, art and aesthetic experience, gender and identity) and canonical authors, and a sense of how they relate to the rival schools of thought.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, which includes either \nPHIL\u00a0204\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 458: Seminar in Contemporary Philosophy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n458\n\n\n\n\nSeminar in Contemporary Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course will explore some of the influential theories and texts in contemporary philosophy. Contemporary philosophy encompasses a broad range of inquiry, from attention to the treatment of knowledge, reason, and the subject; to ethical and political issues; and to aesthetics and metaphysical problems. Themes may include such questions as: What is the status of the human subject in relation to the world? What is the status of truth once we recognize the radical contingency of our historically-bound existence? What is the relation between aesthetic value and ethical value? What does it mean to exist as a temporal agent? What forms does the exercise of power assume in late-modern societies and what resources does philosophy provide for a critique of societies of control? What resources are there in recent developments in philosophy for revitalizing the ancient ideal of philosophy as a way of life, including the concern with the flourishing life? Through reading and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the central approaches to contemporary philosophy, some of the most pressing issues, as well as the central controversies of contemporary philosophy. Students will develop their interpretative and philosophical skills, while gaining a deeper understanding of central themes and figures in philosophy over the past century.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, which are to include either \nPHIL\u00a0208\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 460: African American Philosophy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\nAfrican American Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course will explore central questions and themes guiding the evolution of African American philosophy in the 19th and 20th centuries. Our course will study three different movements from the era. We begin with slavery and questions of reason, civility, and nationality. We move on to philosophies of value and culture in the early twentieth century, with the focus on secularization and the historical nature of philosophical truth. Finally, we will read the work of black political philosophers, and the turn to Marxism and Hegelianism. Issues to be discussed include the foundation and source of race as knowledge of the world, the nature of blackness and identity, the nation as a locus of consciousness and action, God's role in the universe, and the possibility of an Afro-Pessimism about these things.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFAM 100 or PHIL 009 and \n5\nth semester standing\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nAFAM\u00a0460\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 461: Plato\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n461\n\n\n\n\nPlato\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlato has had, along with his student Aristotle, the greatest influence on the history of Western philosophy of any writer. He synthesized politics and ethics, pedagogy and dialectics, psychology and epistemology, metaphysics and ontology, and even cosmology and theology. He founded Europe's first research institute, which cultivated mathematicians, astronomers, psychologists, rhetoricians, literary scholars, and of course philosophers. He lived at a time of profound political upheaval, in a democratic Athens that had just lost a war of imperial expansion. He wrote dozens of dramatic dialogues, among the greatest works of prose ever, celebrating his teacher Socrates, stunning his readers into puzzlement, and posing problems of self-understanding that would set the philosophical agenda for centuries to come. His works have appealed to skeptics and mystics, formal theorists and creative writers, Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and philosophers of a wide range of sensibilities. This course studies a variable range of his dialogues, with the goal of getting a broad and deep understanding of this author, his intellectual context, and his philosophical reception. Students will also learn about the features of Plato's thought and world that remain culturally salient - the Academy, the Forms, Platonic love, Socratic ignorance, the dialogue form, Platonism and Neoplatonism, and the distinctiveness of Greek philosophy.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, where 3 of those credits are \nPHIL\u00a0200\n or \n6\n of those credits are \nPHIL\u00a0200\n-level courses or 9 credits of any combination of CAMS/GREEK/LATIN courses.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nCAMS\u00a0461\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 468: Jewish Philosophy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n468\n\n\n\n\nJewish Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course explores the rich history of Jewish philosophy since the Medieval Ages through to the 20th-century.

It will examine, in particular, the promise and failure of post-Holocaust ethical theory, with attention to evil, suffering, goodness, witnessing, testimony, trauma, and human rights. Authors include Levi, Agamben, Arendt, Adorno, Levinas, Jonas, and Jankelevitch. Through reading and discussion of primary sources, this course introduces students to these philosophers' leading questions, methods, and conclusions, with reference to their historical context and their impact on later philosophy. The course will make these writings accessible to students without unduly presupposing prior knowledge, while also encouraging students to rise to the challenge with their own critical analysis and creative interpretations.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne course in either JST or PHIL\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nJST\u00a0478\n, \nRLST\u00a0478\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 479: Critical Theory\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n479\n\n\n\n\nCritical Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn this course, the term Critical Theory refers to a distinctive approach to social, cultural, and political theory associated with the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which was founded in 1923. Members of what came to be called the Frankfurt School were sharply critical of the political structures, social institutions, and culture of late capitalist societies such as Germany and the United States (where they lived and worked in exile during the Second World War). They were heavily influenced by the post-Kantian German philosophical tradition, especially the work of Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. This course will focus on the historical development of Critical Theory, with an emphasis on the major figures of the early Frankfurt School: Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Herbert Marcuse. However, since Critical Theory is also an ongoing theoretical project, we will also study some contemporary representatives of this tradition, as well as some of its trenchant critics. After some introductory material, including discussion of the Marxist background of early Critical Theory, the course will focus on the following themes: Modernity, History, and Progress; Psychoanalysis and Critique; Culture and Art; and Race, Antisemitism, and Imperialism. In addition to the authors mentioned above, we will discuss work by such thinkers as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Axel Honneth, Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib, Enrique Dussel, and Angela Davis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, including either \nPHIL\u00a0203\n or \n6\n credits of philosophy at the 200 level\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 485: Heidegger\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n485\n\n\n\n\nHeidegger\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits/Maximum of 6\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMartin Heidegger's masterpiece, Being and Time, is among the fundamental philosophical texts of the 20th century, taking up questions of metaphysics, religion, temporality, ontology, the history of philosophy, language, technology, and aesthetics. His thinking there influenced the development of hermeneutics, existentialism, and postmodernism, and continues to inform contemporary approaches to these topics. This course thus gives pride of place to Being and Time, potentially including also the related The Concept of Time (1924) and The Basic Problems of Phenomenology (1927). Major topics studied will be the primacy of the question of the meaning of being, the ontological difference, the phenomenological method, the critique against Cartesian subjectivity, and the existential characteristics of humans such as \"being-in-the-world,\" temporality, spatiality, historicity, sociality, thrownness, authenticity, inauthenticity, everydayness, and death. Further themes of the course may include the relationship between Heidegger's \"early\" and \"later\" works; the political question in Heidegger, especially after the publication of the Black Notebooks; Heidegger's refusal to apologize for his allegiance to National Socialism; the problematic of ethics within the Heideggerian existential phenomenological account; Heidegger's critique of the metaphysics of presence; Heidegger's critique of technology; the Heideggerian conception of art; Heidegger's understanding of the poetic; and historical and contemporary critiques of Heidegger's thought.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 credits of philosophy, including \nPHIL\u00a0102\n or \n204\n or \n402\n or \n457\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 494: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n494\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 494H: Research Project\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n494H\n\n\n\n\nResearch Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHonors\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 496: Independent Studies\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n496\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCreative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 497: Special Topics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n497\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFormal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL 499: Foreign Study--Philosophy\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHIL\n\n\n499\n\n\n\n\nForeign Study--Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCourses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Humanities\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInternational Cultures (IL)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nLionPATH\n\n\nCollegeNET\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nPrivacy and Legal Statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n            All Rights Reserved.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF of this page\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Complete Bulletin PDFs\nDownload Undergraduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Graduate Bulletin PDF\nDownload Penn State Dickinson Law Bulletin PDF\nDownload College of Medicine Bulletin PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel",

The course draws on the new field of conservation psychology and responds to the University's commitment to becoming a leader in sustainability education. This course is designed for upper-level undergraduate students to satisfy requirements for Psychology degree programs, the Psychology minor, and the Sustainability Leadership minor. Major topics covered include psychological foundations of environmental problems (psychological understanding of unsustainable behavior, psychological perspectives on ethical dimensions of environmental problems, people's place in nature, psychological approaches to promoting sustainable behavior), and the application of psychological principles to specific environmental topics (consumerism and sustainable lifestyles, population overshoot, climate change, land use, water use, energy use, food production and consumption, pollution and waste). Students will be able to apply concepts, theories, and findings to change cognition, motivation, and behavior, with the goal of reducing negative human impacts on the environment. They will be able to write and communicate about their work in the form of a final paper and a class presentation that conform to the standards of psychological research. Assessment methods include weekly journal assignments that document students' application of lecture and reading material to their experiences with nature, their observations about their own negative impacts on the environment, and their actions to reduce negative impacts on the environment. In addition, students will develop a conservation intervention program that targets a specific problem on campus or in a community, for which students review relevant literature, design an intervention program, give a presentation of the program, and submit a final paper on the program.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 420: Advanced Social Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n420\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Social Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn depth study of selected research areas in human social behavior.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 421: Self and Social Judgment\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n421\n\n\n\n\nSelf and Social Judgment\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIndividual's perceptions, evaluations, and decision-making strategies about themselves, others, and social situations or issues.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 422: Human Sexuality\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n422\n\n\n\n\nHuman Sexuality\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPsychological influences on human sexual behavior such as love, sexual orientation, gender, intercourse, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, dysfunctions, and paraphilias.  \nPSYCH\u00a0422\n Human Sexuality (3) \nPSYCH\u00a0422\n, Human Sexuality, is intended to examine the influence of psychological factors on human sexual behavior. Information on male & female anatomy, on the roles/influences of hormones, and on conception/pregnancy will be covered as well as information on gender, sexual orientation, communication, love, sexual harassment, paraphilias, sexually explicit material, and sexual dysfunction.Evaluation will be by means of exams (60% of grade), papers (15% of grade), small group projects (10% of grade), and a poster presentation (15% of grade). The prerequisite for this course is satisfactory completion of \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n. As the course presupposes critical thinking skills and an awareness of research methods in psychology, it is an advanced undergraduate level course requiring junior/senior level standing.For the Psychology major (PSHBS or PSHBA) at Penn State Erie, this course can count either toward (a) the diversity basic course requirement, (b) the advanced course requirement, (c) the special interest course requirement, or (d) elective credit. Psychology minors at Penn State Erie can apply this course toward the 15 credits in psychology beyond \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n requirement. Students in other majors should consult with their academic advisors to determine how this course fits into their program of study.No special facilities are required for this course, though students will need to prepare a poster for presentation.This course is expected to be offered at least once every four semesters.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0212\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0231\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0238\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0243\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0270\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 423: Social Psychology of Interpersonal/Intergroup Relationships\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n423\n\n\n\n\nSocial Psychology of Interpersonal/Intergroup Relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn-depth study of relationships among individuals (e.g., intimate relationships) or groups (e.g., prejudice, cooperation, competition, aggression, and negotiation).\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 424: Applied Social Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n424\n\n\n\n\nApplied Social Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tApplication of social psychological theories and research methods to field settings and to the study of social issues.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 425: Psychology of Human Emotion\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n425\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of Human Emotion\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReviews, critiques, and applies major historical and contemporary psychological theories of emotion experience, understanding, and expression.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0221\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0232\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0238\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0243\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0260\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 426: Language and Thought\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n426\n\n\n\n\nLanguage and Thought\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelations between language and cognition; cognitive implications of normal and impaired language development; cognition and bilingualism.  LING (\nPSYCH\u00a0426\n) 429 Language and Thought (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Is language a special and uniquely human ability that develops and functions independently of other cognitive processes? Do individuals who speak different languages also have different concepts about the meaning of objects and ideas? Does language development depend on exposure to spoken language? In this course we will examine the relation between language and thought by considering evidence on language and cognition in both children and adults. Topics to be covered include the typical development and use of language as well as language and cognition in individuals whose language and/or cognition is impaired in some form. The latter include individuals with aphasia who have sustained brain damage following stroke or head injury, schizophrenics whose language reflects aspects of their disorder, children diagnosed with Williams Syndrome who appear to have good or even precocious language abilities in the face of severe cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's patients in whom semantic memory has begun to deteriorate. The course will also discuss the acquisition of sign language among deaf individuals and the consequences of bilingualism for children raised with two languages and for adults with proficiency in more than a single language.The purpose of this course is to provide a survey of current scholarship on the relation of language and thought, including a review of recent developments in the primary literature. The necessary background is covered in introductory Psychology and Linguistics courses, which serve as alternative prerequisites. Students will learn about the consequences of typical and impaired development for relations between cognition and language ability. It is distinguished from \nPSYCH\u00a0457\n, Psychology of Language, by a focus on the implications of language, language development, and language impairment, for cognitive processes. It covers some topics also addressed by current courses in Linguistics and in Communications Sciences and Disorders, but is distinguished from those courses by its focus on perspectives and theories from cognitive psychology. This course may be used toward the 400-level PSY requirements of the PSYBA and PSYBS majors, and toward the PSY minor. Students typically will be assessed on the basis of class participation and discussion (20%), four papers (total 60%), and an in-class presentation based on reading original research literature (20%). The course typically will be offered once each year at the University Park campus with an enrollment limit of 50.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n or \nLING\u00a01\n or \nLING\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nLING\u00a0429\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 427: L1 Acquisition\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n427\n\n\n\n\nL1 Acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHow children learn their first language; psycholinguistic aspects of lexical, syntactic, semantic, and phonological development.  \nLING\u00a0446\n (\nPSYCH\u00a0427\n) L1 Acquisition (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This course focuses on how children learn their first language from the theoretical perspectives of imitation theories, social construction theories, and innateness theories. In addition, the course covers the various stages of language acquisition including phonological (sound system), morphological (word meaning), syntactical (grammar) and semantic (meaning) development from birth to adulthood. Other related subfields covered in the course include the acquisition of Pidgin and Creole languages, bilingual and multilingual acquisition, and language acquisition and linguistic change.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n or \nLING\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nLING\u00a0446\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 432: Multicultural Psychology in America\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n432\n\n\n\n\nMulticultural Psychology in America\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis course focuses on the central role of culture, race, and ethnicity in the human condition.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0212\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0221\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0232\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0238\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0243\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0270\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUnited States Cultures (US)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 434: Psychology of Gaming\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n434\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUpper level course examining the core psychological principles as they apply to the topic of games.  \nGAME\u00a0434\n / \nPSYCH\u00a0434\n Psychology of Gaming (3) This course looks at how the field of psychology can be applied to understand and improve the world of games. This requires the application of theories and research based in experimental, cognitive and several other disciplines within psychology, including but not limited to cognitive, social, motivation & emotion, and experimental psychology. By applying different theories within these disciplines we can start to understand how humans interact with games and in turn how games have evolved as a result. This course addresses an active research area in psychology, of broad interest to students in Psychology and other disciplines. The course will fulfill a 400-level requirement for students in the PSYCH majors and minors as well as those in the GAME minor.

Students will be exposed to the dilemmas faced in the law and how overlap with the knowledge base and expertise of psychologists. Students will learn about the roles psychologists might play in the court system and the history of their involvement. This will include roles of consultant, policy evaluator, expert witness, assessor, and advocate. Legal issues that emerge in psychological practice will also be covered (e.g., limits to confidentiality, duty to warn, consent issues). Students will gain an understanding of the basic theories of the law and how psychological theories may intersect with these. The emphasis of discussion will be on those affecting children, youth and families. These will include topics such as divorce, child maltreatment, juvenile delinquency, domestic violence, and social welfare. Other topics of the law will also be highlighted (insanity plea, civil commitment). Particular attention will be paid to issues dealing with race, ethnicity, and social class and law and social policy.This course expands the PSY curriculum at the 400-level to include a popular and socially significant topic, and will fulfill a 400-level PSY requirement for Psychology majors and minors. It addresses in detail legal and social policy implications of topics covered in other psychology courses. Significant background in psychology is assumed; thus \nPSYCH\u00a0270\n (Introduction to Abnormal Psychology) is a prerequisite.

Students will learn and apply skills that range from basic attending and listening skills to interviewing skills. In order to facilitate learning, a variety of instructional strategies are to be used including: 1) Lectures and demonstration by the instructor, 2) video-taping of students as they are practicing their skills and providing feedback, 3) small group work for the purpose of practicing skills, analyzing other students' performances, and sharing reactions to the counseling process, and 4) completion of exercises/worksheets handed out in class. Upon successfully completing this course, the learner is expected to be able to engage in basic counseling and interviewing, demonstrate ethical counseling principles relevant to the content of the course, describe a model that represents the counseling process, including the stages of counseling, assess the role of nonverbal communication in counseling, identify and demonstrate basic listening skills, probing, interpretation skills, challenging skills, summarizing skills, and informing skills, assess the use of each basic skill in a multicultural environment, evaluate personal and peer mastery of basic skills, and conduct a brief one-session counseling intervention that facilitates client development and change.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 451: Psychology of Action\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n451\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBasic and applied science of action, from psychological, computational, and physiological perspectives.  \nPSYCH\u00a0451\n Psychology of Action (3) In all walks of life, people must adaptively control their physical movements. Whether in industrial settings, on the highway, in the kitchen, in the studio, in the concert hall, or on the football field, skillful physical action is essential. This course will focus on the means by which skilled physical behaviors are learned, planned, and controlled. The course will focus on a broad range of basic behaviors (e.g., reaching, walking, looking, speaking, and typewriting) as analyzed from several perspectives (physiologically, psycho-logically, and computationally). Basic science as well as practical applications will be emphasized, as will links between movement control and other, related topics such as perception, cognitive development, and robotics.This course addresses topics in an active research area in cognitive psychology. It assumes some prior knowledge of cognitive psychology, requiring \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n as a prerequisite. The course will cover some topics addressed in several Kinesiology courses, but does so from the perspective of cognitive psychology. It will fulfill a 400-level PSY requirement for Psychology majors and minors. Students typically will be assessed on the basis of midterm (25%) and final (35%) exams, brief writing assignments and in-class activities (15%) and research papers or projects (25%). The course will normally be offered once each academic year.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 452: Learning and Memory\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n452\n\n\n\n\nLearning and Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGeneral survey of learning and memory processes as revealed in experimental work with animals and humans.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 455: Cognitive Neuroscience\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Neuroscience\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCognitive Neuroscience strives to understand the brain bases of cognition.

The course will introduce students to basic neuroanatomy, functional imaging techniques including electrophysiology and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as behavioral measures of cognition. We will discuss the experimental techniques and the ways in which inferences about the brain bases of cognition are made. We will consider evidence from healthy adults, as well as from patients with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amnesia, and stroke.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0260A\n Recommended Preparation: \nPSYCH\u00a0200\n or \nSTAT\u00a0200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 456: Advanced Cognitive Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n456\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Cognitive Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn depth study of complex mental processes:  thinking, problem-solving, imagery, symbolic behavior, information-processing, attention, artificial intelligence, and language.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0253\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0260\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 457: Psychology of Language\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n457\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOverview of psychological research and theory on language processes, including speech perception, word recognition, meaning representation, comprehension, and language acquisition.  LING (PSYCH) 457 Psychology of Language (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. How do we process language? Why do we easily adjust to a speaker with a foreign accent? How do young children come to speak the language to which they are exposed? Why is it difficult to learn a second language as an adult? This course focuses on the cognitive processes engaged by language use. Topics to be covered include speech perception, word recognition, representation of word meaning, comprehension of sentences, spoken production of words and sentences, and first and second language acquisition. In addition, the role of language in the study of thought and the role of biological mechanisms in theories of language learning will be discussed, as well as ways in which research on the language of special populations (e.g., deaf signers, dyslexics, aphasics) can inform theories of language processing and representation.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n or \nLING\u00a0100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCross-listed with: \nLING\u00a0457\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 458: Visual Cognition\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n458\n\n\n\n\nVisual Cognition\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOverview of concepts and methods in cognitive visual-spatial processing.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0253\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0260\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 460: Comparative Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\nComparative Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBehavior from standpoint of phylogenetic growth and development; biological implications; comparison of different types of animals, including man.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0260\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 461: Advanced Conditioning and Learning\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n461\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Conditioning and Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAn examination of basic learning processes that have been determined within the context of classical, instrumental, and operant learning situations.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0253\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0256\n or \nPSYCH\u00a0261\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 462: Physiological Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n462\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStudy of the biological bases of behavior and experience, including the anatomy and physiology of the brain and nervous system.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nPSYCH\u00a0260\n or \nBIOL\u00a0110\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 464: Behavior Genetics\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n464\n\n\n\n\nBehavior Genetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSurvey of gene mechanisms and gene-environment interactions in the determination of behavior; emphasis on deviant human behavior.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n and (\nANTH\u00a021\n or \nBISC\u00a02\n or \nBIOL\u00a0133\n or \nBIOL\u00a0222\n)\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 466: The Psychology of Evil\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n466\n\n\n\n\nThe Psychology of Evil\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis seminar will provide a critical study of evil from a psychological science perspective: how to define evil; popular perceptions about evil; the motivations people have to commit evil acts; the situational and personal factors that remove restraints to commit evil acts; and, the process of healing (forgiveness/reconciliation) after evil. By reading primary and secondary literature, we will critically think about these important, empirical questions about human nature. This course will wrestle with provocative questions about human nature. Are humans basically motivated to be good, evil, or both? Who should we trust more in recounting evil actions: victims or perpetrators (or neither)? Does \"pure evil\" exist? Can we ever completely stop evil from happening? How do we heal after experiencing evil?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: \nPSYCH\u00a0100\n Recommended Preparation: \nPSYCH\u00a0200\n and \nPSYCH\u00a0301W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH 467: Psychology of Serial and Mass Murderers\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSYCH\n\n\n467\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of Serial and Mass Murderers\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 Credits\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIt is essential in understanding human behavior for students to include the darker side, murder -  without conscience. This course will enable students to understand the definition of murder, within various classifications of it used in the United States, in particular the phenomenon of serial and mass murder. Students will be able to examine and understand within a historical context the cultural development of monsters, demons and evil and this relationship to serial and mass murder. Importantly, students will explore the biological and genetic foundations of human behavior, develop an understanding of the Diagnostic and Statistical manual (DSM-V) spectrum of personality disorders and how these disorders relate to violent behavior. Hare's PCL-R (Psychopathy Check List- Revised) factors will be examined alongside the examination of serial murder committed by legally insane offenders. Some, but not all serial killers have documented cases of mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia), personality disorders (e.g. borderline and antisocial), and psychopathy, albeit most mass murderers suffer from various psychoses. In addition, students will be able to understand sociological theories as they pertain to violent behavior and include factors such as, the role of the family, sexual and physical abuse, and maladaptive childhood behaviors. Often serial murders are preceded by perpetrators' (i.e., males) use of various types of criminal paraphilia (violent or non-violent). These are examined by students to understand the roles these play in the sexual fantasy development of (i.e., males) perpetrators and specific types of sex crimes. The healthcare industry, a hidden, but important environment for serial murderers, is examined by students in order to understand how occupations are important to serial murderers, as by way of their employment, many have easy access to victims. There are numerous differences between male and female serial killers, and team killers. These differences are explored by students by reviewing case studies of each, which include their profiles, mobility and techniques. Finally, global mass and serial murder is to be explored by students, which compare methods, motives and demographics.

The advanced training provided in this course extends understanding of intervention and prevention program logic models and implementation strategies, and includes a focus on tailoring interventions to account for individual, contextual, and cultural factors. Students began their practicum working with children in \nPSYCH\u00a0477\n and continue to receive training and supervision for ongoing, linked practicum work in this course. The key goals of this course are to help students: 1) build up a \"toolbox\" of therapeutic skills, techniques, and intervention approaches to use in the accompanying practicum and to use in future work with high-risk children, 2) understand how therapeutic group interventions with high-risk children are organized and conducted, and identify the key mechanisms of action that inform intervention design and drive positive child benefits, and 3) become familiar with the resource-base of evidence-based prevention programs and implementation supports to foster dissemination in communities. Lectures, class discussions, and presentations are included, along with practicum work review and supervision; accompanying practicum work with children is required.
